<h1>Palm OS Development Documentation</h1>

<i>Using PRC-Tools</i> gives an overview of the whole tool chain, and
details of features specific to this Palm&nbsp;OS port.
The remainder are the user manuals for the various
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> packages used in the tool chain.

<p>
<ul>
<li> Using <b><a href="texi/prc-tools.html">PRC-Tools</a></b>:
     Palm&nbsp;OS-specific aspects of building and debugging programs
<li> Using the <b><a href="texi/gcc.html">GNU Compiler Collection</a></b>:
     C and C++ on Palm OS
<li> Using the <b><a href="texi/cpp.html">preprocessor</a></b>:
     #define, #include, and friends
<li> Debugging remotely with <b><a href="texi/gdb.html">GDB</a></b>
<li> Specifics of the <b><a href="texi/ld.html">linker</a></b>
     and <b><a href="texi/as.html">assembler</a></b>
<li> Other <b><a href="texi/binutils.html">binary utilities</a></b>
     for dealing with object files
<li> Using <b><a href="texi/make.html">make</a></b>
     to build your project
</ul>

<p>
The tools described in these manuals can be configured for use with
several different targets.  Historically, prc-tools was configured for
<code>m68k-palmos-coff</code>; nowadays it is normally configured for
<code>m68k-palmos</code> and <code>arm-palmos</code>.

<p>
These manuals refer to the tools they describe using their generic
target-neutral names.  Most tools in the prc-tools package are
<i>cross-compiler</i> tools rather than <i>native</i> ones, and the
convention is to prefix these commands with their target so as to
distinguish them from their native counterparts.  For example, the GDB
manual describes the <code>gdb</code> command, but for debugging against a
Palm&nbsp;OS device you actually want to use the <code>m68k-palmos-gdb</code>
<!-- or eventually <code>arm-palmos-gdb</code>--> command.

<p>
The exceptions are <code>make</code>, which is a native tool and
neither has nor needs any Palm&nbsp;OS-specific functionality, and
<code>build-prc</code> and <code>palmdev-prep</code>, which are
Palm&nbsp;OS-specific but not specific to any one particular Palm&nbsp;OS
target.  In these cases, the command you type is just the name of the
utility, as is.
