<H2> 4.9 Special Built-in Target Names </H2>
<!--docid::SEC44::-->
<P>

Certain names have special meanings if they appear as targets.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX116"></A>
<DT><CODE>.PHONY</CODE>
<DD><P>

The prerequisites of the special target <CODE>.PHONY</CODE> are considered to
be phony targets.  When it is time to consider such a target,
<CODE>make</CODE> will run its commands unconditionally, regardless of
whether a file with that name exists or what its last-modification
time is.  See section <A HREF="make_37.html#SEC41">Phony Targets</A>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX117"></A>
<DT><CODE>.SUFFIXES</CODE>
<DD><P>

The prerequisites of the special target <CODE>.SUFFIXES</CODE> are the list
of suffixes to be used in checking for suffix rules.
See section <A HREF="make_112.html#SEC116">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</A>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX118"></A>
<DT><CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE>
<DD><P>

The commands specified for <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE> are used for any target for
which no rules are found (either explicit rules or implicit rules).
See section <A HREF="make_111.html#SEC115">10.6 Defining Last-Resort Default Rules</A>.  If <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE> commands are specified, every
file mentioned as a prerequisite, but not as a target in a rule, will have
these commands executed on its behalf.  See section <A HREF="make_113.html#SEC117">Implicit Rule Search Algorithm</A>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX119"></A>
<DT><CODE>.PRECIOUS</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX120"></A>
<A NAME="IDX121"></A>
<P>

The targets which <CODE>.PRECIOUS</CODE> depends on are given the following
special treatment: if <CODE>make</CODE> is killed or interrupted during the
execution of their commands, the target is not deleted.
See section <A HREF="make_53.html#SEC57">Interrupting or Killing <CODE>make</CODE></A>.  Also, if the
target is an intermediate file, it will not be deleted after it is no
longer needed, as is normally done.  See section <A HREF="make_103.html#SEC107">Chains of Implicit Rules</A>.  In this latter respect it overlaps with the
<CODE>.SECONDARY</CODE> special target.
</P><P>

You can also list the target pattern of an implicit rule (such as
<SAMP>`%.o'</SAMP>) as a prerequisite file of the special target <CODE>.PRECIOUS</CODE>
to preserve intermediate files created by rules whose target patterns
match that file's name.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
<DT><CODE>.INTERMEDIATE</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX123"></A>
<P>

The targets which <CODE>.INTERMEDIATE</CODE> depends on are treated as
intermediate files.  See section <A HREF="make_103.html#SEC107">Chains of Implicit Rules</A>.
<CODE>.INTERMEDIATE</CODE> with no prerequisites has no effect.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX124"></A>
<DT><CODE>.SECONDARY</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX125"></A>
<A NAME="IDX126"></A>
<P>

The targets which <CODE>.SECONDARY</CODE> depends on are treated as
intermediate files, except that they are never automatically deleted.
See section <A HREF="make_103.html#SEC107">Chains of Implicit Rules</A>.
</P><P>

<CODE>.SECONDARY</CODE> with no prerequisites causes all targets to be treated
as secondary (i.e., no target is removed because it is considered
intermediate).
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX127"></A>
<DT><CODE>.DELETE_ON_ERROR</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX128"></A>
<P>

If <CODE>.DELETE_ON_ERROR</CODE> is mentioned as a target anywhere in the
makefile, then <CODE>make</CODE> will delete the target of a rule if it has
changed and its commands exit with a nonzero exit status, just as it
does when it receives a signal.  See section <A HREF="make_52.html#SEC56">Errors in Commands</A>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX129"></A>
<DT><CODE>.IGNORE</CODE>
<DD><P>

If you specify prerequisites for <CODE>.IGNORE</CODE>, then <CODE>make</CODE> will
ignore errors in execution of the commands run for those particular
files.  The commands for <CODE>.IGNORE</CODE> are not meaningful.
</P><P>

If mentioned as a target with no prerequisites, <CODE>.IGNORE</CODE> says to
ignore errors in execution of commands for all files.  This usage of
<SAMP>`.IGNORE'</SAMP> is supported only for historical compatibility.  Since
this affects every command in the makefile, it is not very useful; we
recommend you use the more selective ways to ignore errors in specific
commands.  See section <A HREF="make_52.html#SEC56">Errors in Commands</A>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX130"></A>
<DT><CODE>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME</CODE>
<DD><P>

If you specify prerequisites for <CODE>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME</CODE>,
<CODE>make</CODE> assumes that these files are created by commands that
generate low resolution time stamps.  The commands for
<CODE>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME</CODE> are not meaningful.
</P><P>

The high resolution file time stamps of many modern hosts lessen the
chance of <CODE>make</CODE> incorrectly concluding that a file is up to
date.  Unfortunately, these hosts provide no way to set a high
resolution file time stamp, so commands like <SAMP>`cp -p'</SAMP> that
explicitly set a file's time stamp must discard its subsecond part.  If
a file is created by such a command, you should list it as a
prerequisite of <CODE>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME</CODE> so that <CODE>make</CODE> does
not mistakenly conclude that the file is out of date.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME: dst
dst: src
        cp -p src dst
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Since <SAMP>`cp -p'</SAMP> discards the subsecond part of <TT>`src'</TT>'s time
stamp, <TT>`dst'</TT> is typically slightly older than <TT>`src'</TT> even when
it is up to date.  The <CODE>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME</CODE> line causes
<CODE>make</CODE> to consider <TT>`dst'</TT> to be up to date if its time stamp
is at the start of the same second that <TT>`src'</TT>'s time stamp is in.
</P><P>

Due to a limitation of the archive format, archive member time stamps
are always low resolution.  You need not list archive members as
prerequisites of <CODE>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME</CODE>, as <CODE>make</CODE> does this
automatically.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX131"></A>
<DT><CODE>.SILENT</CODE>
<DD><P>

If you specify prerequisites for <CODE>.SILENT</CODE>, then <CODE>make</CODE> will
not print the commands to remake those particular files before executing
them.  The commands for <CODE>.SILENT</CODE> are not meaningful.
</P><P>

If mentioned as a target with no prerequisites, <CODE>.SILENT</CODE> says not
to print any commands before executing them.  This usage of
<SAMP>`.SILENT'</SAMP> is supported only for historical compatibility.  We
recommend you use the more selective ways to silence specific commands.
See section <A HREF="make_49.html#SEC53">Command Echoing</A>.  If you want to silence all commands
for a particular run of <CODE>make</CODE>, use the <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--silent'</SAMP> option (see section <A HREF="make_98.html#SEC102">9.7 Summary of Options</A>).
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX132"></A>
<DT><CODE>.EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES</CODE>
<DD><P>

Simply by being mentioned as a target, this tells <CODE>make</CODE> to
export all variables to child processes by default.
See section <A HREF="make_56.html#SEC60">Communicating Variables to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX133"></A>
<DT><CODE>.NOTPARALLEL</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX134"></A>
<P>

If <CODE>.NOTPARALLEL</CODE> is mentioned as a target, then this invocation of
<CODE>make</CODE> will be run serially, even if the <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option is
given.  Any recursively invoked <CODE>make</CODE> command will still be run in
parallel (unless its makefile contains this target).  Any prerequisites
on this target are ignored.
</DL>
<P>

Any defined implicit rule suffix also counts as a special target if it
appears as a target, and so does the concatenation of two suffixes, such
as <SAMP>`.c.o'</SAMP>.  These targets are suffix rules, an obsolete way of
defining implicit rules (but a way still widely used).  In principle, any
target name could be special in this way if you break it in two and add
both pieces to the suffix list.  In practice, suffixes normally begin with
<SAMP>`.'</SAMP>, so these special target names also begin with <SAMP>`.'</SAMP>.
See section <A HREF="make_112.html#SEC116">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</A>.
