<H3> 5.1.2 Setting watchpoints </H3>
<!--docid::SEC30::-->

You can use a watchpoint to stop execution whenever the value of an
expression changes, without having to predict a particular place where
this may happen.
</P><P>

Depending on your system, watchpoints may be implemented in software or
hardware.  GDB does software watchpointing by single-stepping your
program and testing the variable's value each time, which is hundreds of
times slower than normal execution.  (But this may still be worth it, to
catch errors where you have no clue what part of your program is the
culprit.)
</P><P>

On some systems, such as HP-UX, GNU/Linux and some other x86-based targets,
GDB includes support for
hardware watchpoints, which do not slow down the running of your
program.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX155"></A>
<DT><CODE>watch <VAR>expr</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Set a watchpoint for an expression.  GDB will break when <VAR>expr</VAR>
is written into by the program and its value changes.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX156"></A>
<DT><CODE>rwatch <VAR>expr</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Set a watchpoint that will break when watch <VAR>expr</VAR> is read by the program.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX157"></A>
<DT><CODE>awatch <VAR>expr</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Set a watchpoint that will break when <VAR>expr</VAR> is either read or written into
by the program.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX158"></A>
<DT><CODE>info watchpoints</CODE>
<DD>This command prints a list of watchpoints, breakpoints, and catchpoints;
it is the same as <CODE>info break</CODE>.
</DL>
<P>

GDB sets a <EM>hardware watchpoint</EM> if possible.  Hardware
watchpoints execute very quickly, and the debugger reports a change in
value at the exact instruction where the change occurs.  If GDB
cannot set a hardware watchpoint, it sets a software watchpoint, which
executes more slowly and reports the change in value at the next
statement, not the instruction, after the change occurs.
</P><P>

When you issue the <CODE>watch</CODE> command, GDB reports
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>Hardware watchpoint <VAR>num</VAR>: <VAR>expr</VAR>
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

if it was able to set a hardware watchpoint.
</P><P>

Currently, the <CODE>awatch</CODE> and <CODE>rwatch</CODE> commands can only set
hardware watchpoints, because accesses to data that don't change the
value of the watched expression cannot be detected without examining
every instruction as it is being executed, and GDB does not do
that currently.  If GDB finds that it is unable to set a
hardware breakpoint with the <CODE>awatch</CODE> or <CODE>rwatch</CODE> command, it
will print a message like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>Expression cannot be implemented with read/access watchpoint.
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Sometimes, GDB cannot set a hardware watchpoint because the
data type of the watched expression is wider than what a hardware
watchpoint on the target machine can handle.  For example, some systems
can only watch regions that are up to 4 bytes wide; on such systems you
cannot set hardware watchpoints for an expression that yields a
double-precision floating-point number (which is typically 8 bytes
wide).  As a work-around, it might be possible to break the large region
into a series of smaller ones and watch them with separate watchpoints.
</P><P>

If you set too many hardware watchpoints, GDB might be unable
to insert all of them when you resume the execution of your program.
Since the precise number of active watchpoints is unknown until such
time as the program is about to be resumed, GDB might not be
able to warn you about this when you set the watchpoints, and the
warning will be printed only when the program is resumed:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>Hardware watchpoint <VAR>num</VAR>: Could not insert watchpoint
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If this happens, delete or disable some of the watchpoints.
</P><P>

The SPARClite DSU will generate traps when a program accesses some data
or instruction address that is assigned to the debug registers.  For the
data addresses, DSU facilitates the <CODE>watch</CODE> command.  However the
hardware breakpoint registers can only take two data watchpoints, and
both watchpoints must be the same kind.  For example, you can set two
watchpoints with <CODE>watch</CODE> commands, two with <CODE>rwatch</CODE> commands,
<STRONG>or</STRONG> two with <CODE>awatch</CODE> commands, but you cannot set one
watchpoint with one command and the other with a different command.
GDB will reject the command if you try to mix watchpoints.
Delete or disable unused watchpoint commands before setting new ones.
</P><P>

If you call a function interactively using <CODE>print</CODE> or <CODE>call</CODE>,
any watchpoints you have set will be inactive until GDB reaches another
kind of breakpoint or the call completes.
</P><P>

GDB automatically deletes watchpoints that watch local
(automatic) variables, or expressions that involve such variables, when
they go out of scope, that is, when the execution leaves the block in
which these variables were defined.  In particular, when the program
being debugged terminates, <EM>all</EM> local variables go out of scope,
and so only watchpoints that watch global variables remain set.  If you
rerun the program, you will need to set all such watchpoints again.  One
way of doing that would be to set a code breakpoint at the entry to the
<CODE>main</CODE> function and when it breaks, set all the watchpoints.

<EM>Warning:</EM> In multi-thread programs, watchpoints have only limited
usefulness.  With the current watchpoint implementation, GDB
can only watch the value of an expression <EM>in a single thread</EM>.  If
you are confident that the expression can only change due to the current
thread's activity (and if you are also confident that no other thread
can become current), then you can use watchpoints as usual.  However,
GDB may not notice when a non-current thread's activity changes
the expression.
<P>

<EM>HP-UX Warning:</EM> In multi-thread programs, software watchpoints
have only limited usefulness.  If GDB creates a software
watchpoint, it can only watch the value of an expression <EM>in a
single thread</EM>.  If you are confident that the expression can only
change due to the current thread's activity (and if you are also
confident that no other thread can become current), then you can use
software watchpoints as usual.  However, GDB may not notice
when a non-current thread's activity changes the expression.  (Hardware
watchpoints, in contrast, watch an expression in all threads.)
