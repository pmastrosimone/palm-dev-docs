When writing the <CODE>install</CODE> target, you must classify all the
commands into three categories: normal ones, <EM>pre-installation</EM>
commands and <EM>post-installation</EM> commands.
</P><P>

Normal commands move files into their proper places, and set their
modes.  They may not alter any files except the ones that come entirely
from the package they belong to.
</P><P>

Pre-installation and post-installation commands may alter other files;
in particular, they can edit global configuration files or data bases.
</P><P>

Pre-installation commands are typically executed before the normal
commands, and post-installation commands are typically run after the
normal commands.
</P><P>

The most common use for a post-installation command is to run
<CODE>install-info</CODE>.  This cannot be done with a normal command, since
it alters a file (the Info directory) which does not come entirely and
solely from the package being installed.  It is a post-installation
command because it needs to be done after the normal command which
installs the package's Info files.
</P><P>

Most programs don't need any pre-installation commands, but we have the
feature just in case it is needed.
</P><P>

To classify the commands in the <CODE>install</CODE> rule into these three
categories, insert <EM>category lines</EM> among them.  A category line
specifies the category for the commands that follow.
</P><P>

A category line consists of a tab and a reference to a special Make
variable, plus an optional comment at the end.  There are three
variables you can use, one for each category; the variable name
specifies the category.  Category lines are no-ops in ordinary execution
because these three Make variables are normally undefined (and you
<EM>should not</EM> define them in the makefile).
</P><P>

Here are the three possible category lines, each with a comment that
explains what it means:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>        $(PRE_INSTALL)     # Pre-install commands follow.
        $(POST_INSTALL)    # Post-install commands follow.
        $(NORMAL_INSTALL)  # Normal commands follow.
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If you don't use a category line at the beginning of the <CODE>install</CODE>
rule, all the commands are classified as normal until the first category
line.  If you don't use any category lines, all the commands are
classified as normal.
</P><P>

These are the category lines for <CODE>uninstall</CODE>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>        $(PRE_UNINSTALL)     # Pre-uninstall commands follow.
        $(POST_UNINSTALL)    # Post-uninstall commands follow.
        $(NORMAL_UNINSTALL)  # Normal commands follow.
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Typically, a pre-uninstall command would be used for deleting entries
from the Info directory.
</P><P>

If the <CODE>install</CODE> or <CODE>uninstall</CODE> target has any dependencies
which act as subroutines of installation, then you should start
<EM>each</EM> dependency's commands with a category line, and start the
main target's commands with a category line also.  This way, you can
ensure that each command is placed in the right category regardless of
which of the dependencies actually run.
</P><P>

Pre-installation and post-installation commands should not run any
programs except for these:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>[ basename bash cat chgrp chmod chown cmp cp dd diff echo
egrep expand expr false fgrep find getopt grep gunzip gzip
hostname install install-info kill ldconfig ln ls md5sum
mkdir mkfifo mknod mv printenv pwd rm rmdir sed sort tee
test touch true uname xargs yes
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The reason for distinguishing the commands in this way is for the sake
of making binary packages.  Typically a binary package contains all the
executables and other files that need to be installed, and has its own
method of installing them--so it does not need to run the normal
installation commands.  But installing the binary package does need to
execute the pre-installation and post-installation commands.
</P><P>

Programs to build binary packages work by extracting the
pre-installation and post-installation commands.  Here is one way of
extracting the pre-installation commands:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>make -n install -o all \
      PRE_INSTALL=pre-install \
      POST_INSTALL=post-install \
      NORMAL_INSTALL=normal-install \
  | gawk -f pre-install.awk
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

where the file <TT>`pre-install.awk'</TT> could contain this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>$0 ~ /^\t[ \t]*(normal_install|post_install)[ \t]*$/ {on = 0}
on {print $0}
$0 ~ /^\t[ \t]*pre_install[ \t]*$/ {on = 1}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The resulting file of pre-installation commands is executed as a shell
script as part of installing the binary package.
</P><P>
