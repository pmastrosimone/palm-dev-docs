<H2> 4.32 Assembler Instructions with C Expression Operands </H2>
<!--docid::SEC93::-->
<P>

In an assembler instruction using <CODE>asm</CODE>, you can specify the
operands of the instruction using C expressions.  This means you need not
guess which registers or memory locations will contain the data you want
to use.
</P><P>

You must specify an assembler instruction template much like what
appears in a machine description, plus an operand constraint string for
each operand.
</P><P>

For example, here is how to use the 68881's <CODE>fsinx</CODE> instruction:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>asm ("fsinx %1,%0" : "=f" (result) : "f" (angle));
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here <CODE>angle</CODE> is the C expression for the input operand while
<CODE>result</CODE> is that of the output operand.  Each has <SAMP>`"f"'</SAMP> as its
operand constraint, saying that a floating point register is required.
The <SAMP>`='</SAMP> in <SAMP>`=f'</SAMP> indicates that the operand is an output; all
output operands' constraints must use <SAMP>`='</SAMP>.  The constraints use the
same language used in the machine description (see section <A HREF="gcc_95.html#SEC95">4.33 Constraints for <CODE>asm</CODE> Operands</A>).
</P><P>

Each operand is described by an operand-constraint string followed by
the C expression in parentheses.  A colon separates the assembler
template from the first output operand and another separates the last
output operand from the first input, if any.  Commas separate the
operands within each group.  The total number of operands is limited to
ten or to the maximum number of operands in any instruction pattern in
the machine description, whichever is greater.
</P><P>

If there are no output operands but there are input operands, you must
place two consecutive colons surrounding the place where the output
operands would go.
</P><P>

Output operand expressions must be lvalues; the compiler can check this.
The input operands need not be lvalues.  The compiler cannot check
whether the operands have data types that are reasonable for the
instruction being executed.  It does not parse the assembler instruction
template and does not know what it means or even whether it is valid
assembler input.  The extended <CODE>asm</CODE> feature is most often used for
machine instructions the compiler itself does not know exist.  If
the output expression cannot be directly addressed (for example, it is a
bit field), your constraint must allow a register.  In that case, GNU CC
will use the register as the output of the <CODE>asm</CODE>, and then store
that register into the output.
</P><P>

The ordinary output operands must be write-only; GNU CC will assume that
the values in these operands before the instruction are dead and need
not be generated.  Extended asm supports input-output or read-write
operands.  Use the constraint character <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> to indicate such an
operand and list it with the output operands.
</P><P>

When the constraints for the read-write operand (or the operand in which
only some of the bits are to be changed) allows a register, you may, as
an alternative, logically split its function into two separate operands,
one input operand and one write-only output operand.  The connection
between them is expressed by constraints which say they need to be in
the same location when the instruction executes.  You can use the same C
expression for both operands, or different expressions.  For example,
here we write the (fictitious) <SAMP>`combine'</SAMP> instruction with
<CODE>bar</CODE> as its read-only source operand and <CODE>foo</CODE> as its
read-write destination:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>asm ("combine %2,%0" : "=r" (foo) : "0" (foo), "g" (bar));
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The constraint <SAMP>`"0"'</SAMP> for operand 1 says that it must occupy the
same location as operand 0.  A digit in constraint is allowed only in an
input operand and it must refer to an output operand.
</P><P>

Only a digit in the constraint can guarantee that one operand will be in
the same place as another.  The mere fact that <CODE>foo</CODE> is the value
of both operands is not enough to guarantee that they will be in the
same place in the generated assembler code.  The following would not
work reliably:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>asm ("combine %2,%0" : "=r" (foo) : "r" (foo), "g" (bar));
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Various optimizations or reloading could cause operands 0 and 1 to be in
different registers; GNU CC knows no reason not to do so.  For example, the
compiler might find a copy of the value of <CODE>foo</CODE> in one register and
use it for operand 1, but generate the output operand 0 in a different
register (copying it afterward to <CODE>foo</CODE>'s own address).  Of course,
since the register for operand 1 is not even mentioned in the assembler
code, the result will not work, but GNU CC can't tell that.
</P><P>

Some instructions clobber specific hard registers.  To describe this,
write a third colon after the input operands, followed by the names of
the clobbered hard registers (given as strings).  Here is a realistic
example for the VAX:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>asm volatile ("movc3 %0,%1,%2"
              : /* no outputs */
              : "g" (from), "g" (to), "g" (count)
              : "r0", "r1", "r2", "r3", "r4", "r5");
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

It is an error for a clobber description to overlap an input or output
operand (for example, an operand describing a register class with one
member, mentioned in the clobber list).  Most notably, it is invalid to
describe that an input operand is modified, but unused as output.  It has
to be specified as an input and output operand anyway.  Note that if there
are only unused output operands, you will then also need to specify
<CODE>volatile</CODE> for the <CODE>asm</CODE> construct, as described below.
</P><P>

If you refer to a particular hardware register from the assembler code,
you will probably have to list the register after the third colon to
tell the compiler the register's value is modified.  In some assemblers,
the register names begin with <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>; to produce one <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> in the
assembler code, you must write <SAMP>`%%'</SAMP> in the input.
</P><P>

If your assembler instruction can alter the condition code register, add
<SAMP>`cc'</SAMP> to the list of clobbered registers.  GNU CC on some machines
represents the condition codes as a specific hardware register;
<SAMP>`cc'</SAMP> serves to name this register.  On other machines, the
condition code is handled differently, and specifying <SAMP>`cc'</SAMP> has no
effect.  But it is valid no matter what the machine.
</P><P>

If your assembler instruction modifies memory in an unpredictable
fashion, add <SAMP>`memory'</SAMP> to the list of clobbered registers.  This
will cause GNU CC to not keep memory values cached in registers across
the assembler instruction.
</P><P>

You can put multiple assembler instructions together in a single
<CODE>asm</CODE> template, separated either with newlines (written as
<SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>) or with semicolons if the assembler allows such semicolons.
The GNU assembler allows semicolons and most Unix assemblers seem to do
so.  The input operands are guaranteed not to use any of the clobbered
registers, and neither will the output operands' addresses, so you can
read and write the clobbered registers as many times as you like.  Here
is an example of multiple instructions in a template; it assumes the
subroutine <CODE>_foo</CODE> accepts arguments in registers 9 and 10:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>asm ("movl %0,r9;movl %1,r10;call _foo"
     : /* no outputs */
     : "g" (from), "g" (to)
     : "r9", "r10");
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Unless an output operand has the <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> constraint modifier, GNU CC
may allocate it in the same register as an unrelated input operand, on
the assumption the inputs are consumed before the outputs are produced.
This assumption may be false if the assembler code actually consists of
more than one instruction.  In such a case, use <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> for each output
operand that may not overlap an input.  See section <A HREF="gcc_98.html#SEC98">4.33.3 Constraint Modifier Characters</A>.
</P><P>

If you want to test the condition code produced by an assembler
instruction, you must include a branch and a label in the <CODE>asm</CODE>
construct, as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>asm ("clr %0;frob %1;beq 0f;mov #1,%0;0:"
     : "g" (result)
     : "g" (input));
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This assumes your assembler supports local labels, as the GNU assembler
and most Unix assemblers do.
</P><P>

Speaking of labels, jumps from one <CODE>asm</CODE> to another are not
supported.  The compiler's optimizers do not know about these jumps, and
therefore they cannot take account of them when deciding how to
optimize.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX312"></A>
Usually the most convenient way to use these <CODE>asm</CODE> instructions is to
encapsulate them in macros that look like functions.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define sin(x)       \
({ double __value, __arg = (x);   \
   asm ("fsinx %1,%0": "=f" (__value): "f" (__arg));  \
   __value; })
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here the variable <CODE>__arg</CODE> is used to make sure that the instruction
operates on a proper <CODE>double</CODE> value, and to accept only those
arguments <CODE>x</CODE> which can convert automatically to a <CODE>double</CODE>.
</P><P>

Another way to make sure the instruction operates on the correct data
type is to use a cast in the <CODE>asm</CODE>.  This is different from using a
variable <CODE>__arg</CODE> in that it converts more different types.  For
example, if the desired type were <CODE>int</CODE>, casting the argument to
<CODE>int</CODE> would accept a pointer with no complaint, while assigning the
argument to an <CODE>int</CODE> variable named <CODE>__arg</CODE> would warn about
using a pointer unless the caller explicitly casts it.
</P><P>

If an <CODE>asm</CODE> has output operands, GNU CC assumes for optimization
purposes the instruction has no side effects except to change the output
operands.  This does not mean instructions with a side effect cannot be
used, but you must be careful, because the compiler may eliminate them
if the output operands aren't used, or move them out of loops, or
replace two with one if they constitute a common subexpression.  Also,
if your instruction does have a side effect on a variable that otherwise
appears not to change, the old value of the variable may be reused later
if it happens to be found in a register.
</P><P>

You can prevent an <CODE>asm</CODE> instruction from being deleted, moved
significantly, or combined, by writing the keyword <CODE>volatile</CODE> after
the <CODE>asm</CODE>.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define get_and_set_priority(new)  \
({ int __old; \
   asm volatile ("get_and_set_priority %0, %1": "=g" (__old) : "g" (new)); \
   __old; })
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If you write an <CODE>asm</CODE> instruction with no outputs, GNU CC will know
the instruction has side-effects and will not delete the instruction or
move it outside of loops.  If the side-effects of your instruction are
not purely external, but will affect variables in your program in ways
other than reading the inputs and clobbering the specified registers or
memory, you should write the <CODE>volatile</CODE> keyword to prevent future
versions of GNU CC from moving the instruction around within a core
region.
</P><P>

An <CODE>asm</CODE> instruction without any operands or clobbers (and "old
style" <CODE>asm</CODE>) will not be deleted or moved significantly,
regardless, unless it is unreachable, the same wasy as if you had
written a <CODE>volatile</CODE> keyword.
</P><P>

Note that even a volatile <CODE>asm</CODE> instruction can be moved in ways
that appear insignificant to the compiler, such as across jump
instructions.  You can't expect a sequence of volatile <CODE>asm</CODE>
instructions to remain perfectly consecutive.  If you want consecutive
output, use a single <CODE>asm</CODE>.
</P><P>

It is a natural idea to look for a way to give access to the condition
code left by the assembler instruction.  However, when we attempted to
implement this, we found no way to make it work reliably.  The problem
is that output operands might need reloading, which would result in
additional following "store" instructions.  On most machines, these
instructions would alter the condition code before there was time to
test it.  This problem doesn't arise for ordinary "test" and
"compare" instructions because they don't have any output operands.
</P><P>

If you are writing a header file that should be includable in ANSI C
programs, write <CODE>__asm__</CODE> instead of <CODE>asm</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="gcc_104.html#SEC104">4.36 Alternate Keywords</A>.
