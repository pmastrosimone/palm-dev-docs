<H2> Contributors to GDB </H2>
<!--docid::SEC4::-->
<P>

Richard Stallman was the original author of GDB, and of many
other GNU programs.  Many others have contributed to its
development.  This section attempts to credit major contributors.  One
of the virtues of free software is that everyone is free to contribute
to it; with regret, we cannot actually acknowledge everyone here.  The
file <TT>`ChangeLog'</TT> in the GDB distribution approximates a
blow-by-blow account.
</P><P>

Changes much prior to version 2.0 are lost in the mists of time.
</P><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>Plea:</EM> Additions to this section are particularly welcome.  If you
or your friends (or enemies, to be evenhanded) have been unfairly
omitted from this list, we would like to add your names!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

So that they may not regard their many labors as thankless, we
particularly thank those who shepherded GDB through major
releases:
Andrew Cagney (releases 5.3, 5.2, 5.1 and 5.0);
Jim Blandy (release 4.18);
Jason Molenda (release 4.17);
Stan Shebs (release 4.14);
Fred Fish (releases 4.16, 4.15, 4.13, 4.12, 4.11, 4.10, and 4.9);
Stu Grossman and John Gilmore (releases 4.8, 4.7, 4.6, 4.5, and 4.4);
John Gilmore (releases 4.3, 4.2, 4.1, 4.0, and 3.9);
Jim Kingdon (releases 3.5, 3.4, and 3.3);
and Randy Smith (releases 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0).
