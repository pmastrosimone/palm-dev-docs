<H2> 2.8 Options That Control Optimization </H2>
<!--docid::SEC10::-->
<P>

These options control various sorts of optimizations:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-O</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-O1</CODE>
<DD>Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.
<P>

Without <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, the compiler's goal is to reduce the cost of
compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results.
Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a breakpoint
between statements, you can then assign a new value to any variable or
change the program counter to any other statement in the function and
get exactly the results you would expect from the source code.
</P><P>

Without <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, the compiler only allocates variables declared
<CODE>register</CODE> in registers.  The resulting compiled code is a little
worse than produced by PCC without <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

With <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time.
</P><P>

When you specify <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, the compiler turns on <SAMP>`-fthread-jumps'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`-fdefer-pop'</SAMP> on all machines.  The compiler turns on
<SAMP>`-fdelayed-branch'</SAMP> on machines that have delay slots, and
<SAMP>`-fomit-frame-pointer'</SAMP> on machines that can support debugging even
without a frame pointer.  On some machines the compiler also turns
on other flags.</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-O2</CODE>
<DD>Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  The compiler does not
perform loop unrolling or function inlining when you specify <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP>.
As compared to <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.
<P>

<SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP> turns on all optional optimizations except for loop unrolling,
function inlining, and strict aliasing optimizations.  It also turns on the
<SAMP>`-fforce-mem'</SAMP> option on all machines and frame pointer elimination on
machines where doing so does not interfere with debugging.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-O3</CODE>
<DD>Optimize yet more.  <SAMP>`-O3'</SAMP> turns on all optimizations specified by
<SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP> and also turns on the <SAMP>`inline-functions'</SAMP> option.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-O0</CODE>
<DD>Do not optimize.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Os</CODE>
<DD>Optimize for size.  <SAMP>`-Os'</SAMP> enables all <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP> optimizations that
do not typically increase code size.  It also performs further
optimizations designed to reduce code size.
<P>

If you use multiple <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective.
</DL>
<P>

Options of the form <SAMP>`-f<VAR>flag</VAR>'</SAMP> specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of <SAMP>`-ffoo'</SAMP> would be <SAMP>`-fno-foo'</SAMP>.  In the table below,
only one of the forms is listed--the one which is not the default.
You can figure out the other form by either removing <SAMP>`no-'</SAMP> or
adding it.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-ffloat-store</CODE>
<DD>Do not store floating point variables in registers, and inhibit other
options that might change whether a floating point value is taken from a
register or memory.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX70"></A>
This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a <CODE>double</CODE> is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only
good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of IEEE floating
point.  Use <SAMP>`-ffloat-store'</SAMP> for such programs, after modifying
them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-default-inline</CODE>
<DD>Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they are
defined inside the class scope (C++ only).  Otherwise, when you specify
<SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, member functions defined inside class scope are compiled
inline by default; i.e., you don't need to add <SAMP>`inline'</SAMP> in front of
the member function name.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-defer-pop</CODE>
<DD>Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function
returns.  For machines which must pop arguments after a function call,
the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on the stack for several
function calls and pops them all at once.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fforce-mem</CODE>
<DD>Force memory operands to be copied into registers before doing
arithmetic on them.  This produces better code by making all memory
references potential common subexpressions.  When they are not common
subexpressions, instruction combination should eliminate the separate
register-load.  The <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP> option turns on this option.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fforce-addr</CODE>
<DD>Force memory address constants to be copied into registers before
doing arithmetic on them.  This may produce better code just as
<SAMP>`-fforce-mem'</SAMP> may.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fomit-frame-pointer</CODE>
<DD>Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
in many functions.  <STRONG>It also makes debugging impossible on
some machines.</STRONG>
<P>

On some machines, such as the Vax, this flag has no effect, because
the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer
and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
machine-description macro <CODE>FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED</CODE> controls
whether a target machine supports this flag.  See section `Register Usage' in <CITE>Using and Porting GCC</CITE>.</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-inline</CODE>
<DD>Don't pay attention to the <CODE>inline</CODE> keyword.  Normally this option
is used to keep the compiler from expanding any functions inline.
Note that if you are not optimizing, no functions can be expanded inline.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-finline-functions</CODE>
<DD>Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
integrating in this way.
<P>

If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is
declared <CODE>static</CODE>, then the function is normally not output as
assembler code in its own right.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-finline-limit-<VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD>By default, gcc limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows the control of this limit for functions that are explicitly marked as
inline (ie marked with the inline keyword or defined within the class 
definition in c++).  <VAR>n</VAR> is the size of functions that can be inlined in 
number of pseudo instructions (not counting parameter handling).  The default
value of n is 10000.  Increasing this value can result in more inlined code at
the cost of compilation time and memory consumption.  Decreasing usually makes
the compilation faster and less code will be inlined (which presumably 
means slower programs).  This option is particularly useful for programs that 
use inlining heavily such as those based on recursive templates with c++.
<P>

<EM>Note:</EM> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context, an
abstract measurement of function's size.  In no way, it represents a count
of assembly instructions and as such its exact meaning might change from one
release to an another.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fkeep-inline-functions</CODE>
<DD>Even if all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function
is declared <CODE>static</CODE>, nevertheless output a separate run-time
callable version of the function.  This switch does not affect
<CODE>extern inline</CODE> functions.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fkeep-static-consts</CODE>
<DD>Emit variables declared <CODE>static const</CODE> when optimization isn't turned
on, even if the variables aren't referenced.
<P>

GCC enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to
check if the variable was referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the <SAMP>`-fno-keep-static-consts'</SAMP> option.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-function-cse</CODE>
<DD>Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that
calls a constant function contain the function's address explicitly.
<P>

This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
that alter the assembler output may be confused by the optimizations
performed when this option is not used.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-ffast-math</CODE>
<DD>This option allows GCC to violate some ANSI or IEEE rules and/or
specifications in the interest of optimizing code for speed.  For
example, it allows the compiler to assume arguments to the <CODE>sqrt</CODE>
function are non-negative numbers and that no floating-point values
are NaNs.
<P>

This option should never be turned on by any <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on
an exact implementation of IEEE or ANSI rules/specifications for
math functions.
</DL>
<P>

The following options control specific optimizations.  The <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP>
option turns on all of these optimizations except <SAMP>`-funroll-loops'</SAMP>
<SAMP>`-funroll-all-loops'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`-fstrict-aliasing'</SAMP>.  On most machines, the
<SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> option turns on the <SAMP>`-fthread-jumps'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-fdelayed-branch'</SAMP>
options, but specific machines may handle it differently.
</P><P>

You can use the following flags in the rare cases when "fine-tuning"
of optimizations to be performed is desired.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-fstrength-reduce</CODE>
<DD>Perform the optimizations of loop strength reduction and
elimination of iteration variables.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fthread-jumps</CODE>
<DD>Perform optimizations where we check to see if a jump branches to a
location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.  If
so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of the
second branch or a point immediately following it, depending on whether
the condition is known to be true or false.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fcse-follow-jumps</CODE>
<DD>In common subexpression elimination, scan through jump instructions
when the target of the jump is not reached by any other path.  For
example, when CSE encounters an <CODE>if</CODE> statement with an
<CODE>else</CODE> clause, CSE will follow the jump when the condition
tested is false.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fcse-skip-blocks</CODE>
<DD>This is similar to <SAMP>`-fcse-follow-jumps'</SAMP>, but causes CSE to
follow jumps which conditionally skip over blocks.  When CSE
encounters a simple <CODE>if</CODE> statement with no else clause,
<SAMP>`-fcse-skip-blocks'</SAMP> causes CSE to follow the jump around the
body of the <CODE>if</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-frerun-cse-after-loop</CODE>
<DD>Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop optimizations has been
performed.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-frerun-loop-opt</CODE>
<DD>Run the loop optimizer twice.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fgcse</CODE>
<DD>Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass.
This pass also performs global constant and copy propagation.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fexpensive-optimizations</CODE>
<DD>Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively expensive.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-foptimize-register-moves</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-fregmove</CODE>
<DD>Attempt to reassign register numbers in move instructions and as
operands of other simple instructions in order to maximize the amount of
register tying.  This is especially helpful on machines with two-operand
instructions.  GCC enables this optimization by default with <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP>
or higher.
<P>

Note <CODE>-fregmove</CODE> and <CODE>-foptimize-register-moves</CODE> are the same
optimization.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fdelayed-branch</CODE>
<DD>If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions
to exploit instruction slots available after delayed branch
instructions.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fschedule-insns</CODE>
<DD>If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions to
eliminate execution stalls due to required data being unavailable.  This
helps machines that have slow floating point or memory load instructions
by allowing other instructions to be issued until the result of the load
or floating point instruction is required.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fschedule-insns2</CODE>
<DD>Similar to <SAMP>`-fschedule-insns'</SAMP>, but requests an additional pass of
instruction scheduling after register allocation has been done.  This is
especially useful on machines with a relatively small number of
registers and where memory load instructions take more than one cycle.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-ffunction-sections</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-fdata-sections</CODE>
<DD>Place each function or data item into its own section in the output
file if the target supports arbitrary sections.  The name of the
function or the name of the data item determines the section's name
in the output file.
<P>

Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations
to improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  HPPA
processors running HP-UX and Sparc processors running Solaris 2 have
linkers with such optimizations.  Other systems using the ELF object format
as well as AIX may have these optimizations in the future.
</P><P>

Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing
so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and linker will
create larger object and executable files and will also be slower.
You will not be able to use <CODE>gprof</CODE> on all systems if you
specify this option and you may have problems with debugging if
you specify both this option and <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fcaller-saves</CODE>
<DD>Enable values to be allocated in registers that will be clobbered by
function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save and restore the
registers around such calls.  Such allocation is done only when it
seems to result in better code than would otherwise be produced.
<P>

This option is always enabled by default on certain machines, usually
those which have no call-preserved registers to use instead.
</P><P>

For all machines, optimization level 2 and higher enables this flag by
default.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-funroll-loops</CODE>
<DD>Perform the optimization of loop unrolling.  This is only done for loops
whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or run time.
<SAMP>`-funroll-loops'</SAMP> implies both <SAMP>`-fstrength-reduce'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-frerun-cse-after-loop'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-funroll-all-loops</CODE>
<DD>Perform the optimization of loop unrolling.  This is done for all loops
and usually makes programs run more slowly.  <SAMP>`-funroll-all-loops'</SAMP>
implies <SAMP>`-fstrength-reduce'</SAMP> as well as <SAMP>`-frerun-cse-after-loop'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fmove-all-movables</CODE>
<DD>Forces all invariant computations in loops to be moved
outside the loop.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-freduce-all-givs</CODE>
<DD>Forces all general-induction variables in loops to be
strength-reduced.
<P>

<EM>Note:</EM> When compiling programs written in Fortran,
<SAMP>`-fmove-all-movables'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-freduce-all-givs'</SAMP> are enabled
by default when you use the optimizer.
</P><P>

These options may generate better or worse code; results are highly
dependent on the structure of loops within the source code.
</P><P>

These two options are intended to be removed someday, once
they have helped determine the efficacy of various
approaches to improving loop optimizations.
</P><P>

Please let us (<CODE>gcc@gcc.gnu.org</CODE> and <CODE>fortran@gnu.org</CODE>)
know how use of these options affects
the performance of your production code.
We're very interested in code that runs <EM>slower</EM>
when these options are <EM>enabled</EM>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-peephole</CODE>
<DD>Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fbranch-probabilities</CODE>
<DD>After running a program compiled with <SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs'</SAMP>
(see section <A HREF="gcc_9.html#SEC9">Options for Debugging Your Program or <CODE>gcc</CODE></A>), you can compile it a second time using
<SAMP>`-fbranch-probabilities'</SAMP>, to improve optimizations based on
guessing the path a branch might take.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fstrict-aliasing</CODE>
<DD>Allows the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and C++), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an <CODE>unsigned int</CODE> can alias an <CODE>int</CODE>, but not a
<CODE>void*</CODE> or a <CODE>double</CODE>.  A character type may alias any other
type.  
<P>

Pay special attention to code like this:
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>union a_union { 
  int i;
  double d;
};

int f() {
  a_union t;
  t.d = 3.0;
  return t.i;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called "type-punning") is common.  Even with
<SAMP>`-fstrict-aliasing'</SAMP>, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above will work as
expected.  However, this code might not:
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>int f() { 
  a_union t;
  int* ip;
  t.d = 3.0;
  ip = &#38;t.i;
  return *ip;
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>
