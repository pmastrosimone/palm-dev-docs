<H2> 2.5 Options Controlling C++ Dialect </H2>
<!--docid::SEC7::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX50"></A>
<A NAME="IDX51"></A>
<A NAME="IDX52"></A>
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for C++ programs; but you can also use most of the GNU compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file <CODE>firstClass.C</CODE> like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>g++ -g -frepo -O -c firstClass.C
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In this example, only <SAMP>`-frepo'</SAMP> is an option meant
only for C++ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by GCC.
</P><P>

Here is a list of options that are <EM>only</EM> for compiling C++ programs:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-fno-access-control</CODE>
<DD>Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fcheck-new</CODE>
<DD>Check that the pointer returned by <CODE>operator new</CODE> is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  The current Working
Paper requires that <CODE>operator new</CODE> never return a null pointer, so
this check is normally unnecessary.
<P>

An alternative to using this option is to specify that your
<CODE>operator new</CODE> does not throw any exceptions; if you declare it
<SAMP>`throw()'</SAMP>, g++ will check the return value.  See also <SAMP>`new
(nothrow)'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fconserve-space</CODE>
<DD>Put uninitialized or runtime-initialized global variables into the
common segment, as C does.  This saves space in the executable at the
cost of not diagnosing duplicate definitions.  If you compile with this
flag and your program mysteriously crashes after <CODE>main()</CODE> has
completed, you may have an object that is being destroyed twice because
two definitions were merged.
<P>

This option is no longer useful on most targets, now that support has
been added for putting variables into BSS without making them common.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fdollars-in-identifiers</CODE>
<DD>Accept <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> in identifiers.  You can also explicitly prohibit use of
<SAMP>`$'</SAMP> with the option <SAMP>`-fno-dollars-in-identifiers'</SAMP>.  (GNU C allows
<SAMP>`$'</SAMP> by default on most target systems, but there are a few exceptions.)
Traditional C allowed the character <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> to form part of
identifiers.  However, ANSI C and C++ forbid <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> in identifiers.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-elide-constructors</CODE>
<DD>The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
which is only used to initialize another object of the same type.
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces g++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fexternal-templates</CODE>
<DD>Cause template instantiations to obey <SAMP>`#pragma interface'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`implementation'</SAMP>; template instances are emitted or not according
to the location of the template definition.  See section <A HREF="gcc_115.html#SEC115">5.5 Where's the Template?</A>, for more information.
<P>

This option is deprecated.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-falt-external-templates</CODE>
<DD>Similar to -fexternal-templates, but template instances are emitted or
not according to the place where they are first instantiated.
See section <A HREF="gcc_115.html#SEC115">5.5 Where's the Template?</A>, for more information.
<P>

This option is deprecated.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-ffor-scope</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-fno-for-scope</CODE>
<DD>If -ffor-scope is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <I>for-init-statement</I> is limited to the <SAMP>`for'</SAMP> loop itself,
as specified by the draft C++ standard.
If -fno-for-scope is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <I>for-init-statement</I> extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of gcc, and other (traditional)
implementations of C++.
<P>

The default if neither flag is given to follow the standard,
but to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-gnu-keywords</CODE>
<DD>Do not recognize <CODE>classof</CODE>, <CODE>headof</CODE>, <CODE>signature</CODE>,
<CODE>sigof</CODE> or <CODE>typeof</CODE> as a keyword, so that code can use these
words as identifiers.  You can use the keywords <CODE>__classof__</CODE>,
<CODE>__headof__</CODE>, <CODE>__signature__</CODE>, <CODE>__sigof__</CODE>, and
<CODE>__typeof__</CODE> instead.  <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> implies
<SAMP>`-fno-gnu-keywords'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fguiding-decls</CODE>
<DD>Treat a function declaration with the same type as a potential function
template instantiation as though it declares that instantiation, not a
normal function.  If a definition is given for the function later in the
translation unit (or another translation unit if the target supports
weak symbols), that definition will be used; otherwise the template will
be instantiated.  This behavior reflects the C++ language prior to
September 1996, when guiding declarations were removed.
<P>

This option implies <SAMP>`-fname-mangling-version-0'</SAMP>, and will not work
with other name mangling versions.  Like all options that change the
ABI, all C++ code, <EM>including libgcc.a</EM> must be built with the same
setting of this option.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fhandle-signatures</CODE>
<DD>Recognize the <CODE>signature</CODE> and <CODE>sigof</CODE> keywords for specifying
abstract types.  The default (<SAMP>`-fno-handle-signatures'</SAMP>) is not to
recognize them.  See section <A HREF="gcc_117.html#SEC117">Type Abstraction using Signatures</A>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fhonor-std</CODE>
<DD>Treat the <CODE>namespace std</CODE> as a namespace, instead of ignoring
it. For compatibility with earlier versions of g++, the compiler will,
by default, ignore <CODE>namespace-declarations</CODE>,
<CODE>using-declarations</CODE>, <CODE>using-directives</CODE>, and
<CODE>namespace-names</CODE>, if they involve <CODE>std</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fhuge-objects</CODE>
<DD>Support virtual function calls for objects that exceed the size
representable by a <SAMP>`short int'</SAMP>.  Users should not use this flag by
default; if you need to use it, the compiler will tell you so.
<P>

This flag is not useful when compiling with -fvtable-thunks.
</P><P>

Like all options that change the ABI, all C++ code, <EM>including
libgcc</EM> must be built with the same setting of this option.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-implicit-templates</CODE>
<DD>Never emit code for non-inline templates which are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations.
See section <A HREF="gcc_115.html#SEC115">5.5 Where's the Template?</A>, for more information.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-implicit-inline-templates</CODE>
<DD>Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either.
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and
without optimization will need the same set of explicit instantiations.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-finit-priority</CODE>
<DD>Support <SAMP>`__attribute__ ((init_priority (n)))'</SAMP> for controlling the
order of initialization of file-scope objects.  On ELF targets, this
requires GNU ld 2.10 or later.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-implement-inlines</CODE>
<DD>To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by <SAMP>`#pragma implementation'</SAMP>.  This will cause linker
errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fname-mangling-version-<VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Control the way in which names are mangled.  Version 0 is compatible
with versions of g++ before 2.8.  Version 1 is the default.  Version 1
will allow correct mangling of function templates.  For example, 
version 0 mangling does not mangle foo&#60;int, double&#62; and foo&#60;int, char&#62;
given this declaration:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>template &#60;class T, class U&#62; void foo(T t);
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Like all options that change the ABI, all C++ code, <EM>including
libgcc</EM> must be built with the same setting of this option.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-foperator-names</CODE>
<DD>Recognize the operator name keywords <CODE>and</CODE>, <CODE>bitand</CODE>,
<CODE>bitor</CODE>, <CODE>compl</CODE>, <CODE>not</CODE>, <CODE>or</CODE> and <CODE>xor</CODE> as
synonyms for the symbols they refer to.  <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> implies
<SAMP>`-foperator-names'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-optional-diags</CODE>
<DD>Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to
issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by g++ is the one for
a name having multiple meanings within a class.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fpermissive</CODE>
<DD>Downgrade messages about nonconformant code from errors to warnings.  By
default, g++ effectively sets <SAMP>`-pedantic-errors'</SAMP> without
<SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP>; this option reverses that.  This behavior and this
option are superceded by <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP>, which works as it does for GNU C.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-frepo</CODE>
<DD>Enable automatic template instantiation.  This option also implies
<SAMP>`-fno-implicit-templates'</SAMP>.  See section <A HREF="gcc_115.html#SEC115">5.5 Where's the Template?</A>, for more
information.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-rtti</CODE>
<DD>Disable generation of the information used by C++ runtime type
identification features (<SAMP>`dynamic_cast'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`typeid'</SAMP>).  If you
don't use those parts of the language (or exception handling, which uses
<SAMP>`dynamic_cast'</SAMP> internally), you can save some space by using this
flag.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fstrict-prototype</CODE>
<DD>Within an <SAMP>`extern "C"'</SAMP> linkage specification, treat a function
declaration with no arguments, such as <SAMP>`int foo ();'</SAMP>, as declaring
the function to take no arguments.  Normally, such a declaration means
that the function <CODE>foo</CODE> can take any combination of arguments, as
in C.  <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> implies <SAMP>`-fstrict-prototype'</SAMP> unless
overridden with <SAMP>`-fno-strict-prototype'</SAMP>.
<P>

Specifying this option will also suppress implicit declarations of
functions.
</P><P>

This flag no longer affects declarations with C++ linkage.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fsquangle</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-fno-squangle</CODE>
<DD><SAMP>`-fsquangle'</SAMP> will enable a compressed form of name mangling for
identifiers. In particular, it helps to shorten very long names by recognizing
types and class names which occur more than once, replacing them with special
short ID codes.  This option also requires any C++ libraries being used to
be compiled with this option as well.  The compiler has this disabled (the
equivalent of <SAMP>`-fno-squangle'</SAMP>) by default.
<P>

Like all options that change the ABI, all C++ code, <EM>including
libgcc.a</EM> must be built with the same setting of this option.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-ftemplate-depth-<VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to <VAR>n</VAR>.
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation. ANSI/ISO C++
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fthis-is-variable</CODE>
<DD>Permit assignment to <CODE>this</CODE>.  The incorporation of user-defined
free store management into C++ has made assignment to <SAMP>`this'</SAMP> an
anachronism.  Therefore, by default it is invalid to assign to
<CODE>this</CODE> within a class member function; that is, GNU C++ treats
<SAMP>`this'</SAMP> in a member function of class <CODE>X</CODE> as a non-lvalue of
type <SAMP>`X *'</SAMP>.  However, for backwards compatibility, you can make it
valid with <SAMP>`-fthis-is-variable'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fvtable-thunks=<VAR>thunks-version</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Use <SAMP>`thunks'</SAMP> to implement the virtual function dispatch table
(<SAMP>`vtable'</SAMP>).  The traditional (cfront-style) approach to
implementing vtables was to store a pointer to the function and two
offsets for adjusting the <SAMP>`this'</SAMP> pointer at the call site.  Newer
implementations store a single pointer to a <SAMP>`thunk'</SAMP> function which
does any necessary adjustment and then calls the target function.
<P>

The original implementation of thunks (version 1) had a bug regarding
virtual base classes; this bug is fixed with version 2 of the thunks
implementation. With setting the version to 2, compatibility to the
version 1 thunks is provided, at the cost of extra machine code. Version
3 does not include this compatibility.
</P><P>

This option also enables a heuristic for controlling emission of
vtables; if a class has any non-inline virtual functions, the vtable
will be emitted in the translation unit containing the first one of
those.
</P><P>

Like all options that change the ABI, all C++ code, <EM>including
libgcc.a</EM> must be built with the same setting of this option. Since
version 1 and version 2 are also incompatible (for classes with virtual
bases defining virtual functions), all code must also be compiled with
the same version.
</P><P>

In this version of gcc, there are no targets for which version 2 thunks
are the default.  On all targets, not giving the option will use the
traditional implementation, and -fvtable-thunks will produce version 2
thunks.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-nostdinc++</CODE>
<DD>Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to
C++, but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option
is used when building the C++ library.)
</DL>
<P>

In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for C++ programs:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-fno-default-inline</CODE>
<DD>Do not assume <SAMP>`inline'</SAMP> for functions defined inside a class scope.
See section <A HREF="gcc_10.html#SEC10">Options That Control Optimization</A>.  Note that these
functions will have linkage like inline functions; they just won't be
inlined by default.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wctor-dtor-privacy (C++ only)</CODE>
<DD>Warn when a class seems unusable, because all the constructors or
destructors in a class are private and the class has no friends or
public static member functions.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wnon-virtual-dtor (C++ only)</CODE>
<DD>Warn when a class declares a non-virtual destructor that should probably
be virtual, because it looks like the class will be used polymorphically.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wreorder (C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX53"></A>
<A NAME="IDX54"></A>
Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does not
match the order in which they must be executed.  For instance:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct A {
  int i;
  int j;
  A(): j (0), i (1) { }
};
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here the compiler will warn that the member initializers for <SAMP>`i'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`j'</SAMP> will be rearranged to match the declaration order of the
members.
</DL>
<P>

The following <SAMP>`-W<small>...</small>'</SAMP> options are not affected by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-Weffc++ (C++ only)</CODE>
<DD>Warn about violations of various style guidelines from Scott Meyers'
<CITE>Effective C++</CITE> books.  If you use this option, you should be aware
that the standard library headers do not obey all of these guidelines;
you can use <SAMP>`grep -v'</SAMP> to filter out those warnings.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-deprecated (C++ only)</CODE>
<DD>Do not warn about usage of deprecated features. See section <A HREF="gcc_109.html#SEC109">4.41 Deprecated Features</A>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-non-template-friend (C++ only)</CODE>
<DD>Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared
within a template. With the advent of explicit template specification
support in g++, if the name of the friend is an unqualified-id (ie,
<SAMP>`friend foo(int)'</SAMP>), the C++ language specification demands that the
friend declare or define an ordinary, nontemplate function. (Section
14.5.3). Before g++ implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids
could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
function. Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the default
behavior for g++, <SAMP>`-Wnon-template-friend'</SAMP> allows the compiler to
check existing code for potential trouble spots, and is on by default.
This new compiler behavior can also be turned off with the flag
<SAMP>`-fguiding-decls'</SAMP>, which activates the older, non-specification
compiler code, or with <SAMP>`-Wno-non-template-friend'</SAMP> which keeps the
conformant compiler code but disables the helpful warning.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wold-style-cast (C++ only)</CODE>
<DD>Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast is used within a C++ program.  The
new-style casts (<SAMP>`static_cast'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`reinterpret_cast'</SAMP>, and
<SAMP>`const_cast'</SAMP>) are less vulnerable to unintended effects.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Woverloaded-virtual (C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX55"></A>
<A NAME="IDX56"></A>
Warn when a derived class function declaration may be an error in
defining a virtual function.  In a derived class, the
definitions of virtual functions must match the type signature of a
virtual function declared in the base class.  With this option, the
compiler warns when you define a function with the same name as a
virtual function, but with a type signature that does not match any
declarations from the base class.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-pmf-conversions (C++ only)</CODE>
<DD>Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to member function
to a plain pointer.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wsign-promo (C++ only)</CODE>
<DD>Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
enumeral type to a signed type over a conversion to an unsigned type of
the same size.  Previous versions of g++ would try to preserve
unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wsynth (C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX57"></A>
<A NAME="IDX58"></A>
Warn when g++'s synthesis behavior does not match that of cfront.  For
instance:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct A {
  operator int ();
  A&#38; operator = (int);
};

main ()
{
  A a,b;
  a = b;
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In this example, g++ will synthesize a default <SAMP>`A&#38; operator =
(const A&#38;);'</SAMP>, while cfront will use the user-defined <SAMP>`operator ='</SAMP>.
</DL>
