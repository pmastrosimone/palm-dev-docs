<h2 class="HaHeadA">
  <a name="970011"> </a>Why Programming for Palm OS Is Different 
<a href="#969980"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0"></a></h2>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="970012"> </a>Like most programmers, you have probably written a desktop application-an application that is run on a desktop computer such as a PC or a Macintosh computer. Writing applications for handhelds, specifically Palm Powered handhelds, is a bit different from writing desktop applications because the Palm Powered handheld is designed differently than a desktop computer. Also, users simply interact with the handheld differently than they do desktop computers. 
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970013"> </a>This section describes how these differences affect the design of a Palm OS<sup>®</sup> application. 
</p>

<h2 class="HBHeadB">
  <a name="970015"> </a>Screen Size
<a href="#969980"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0"></a></h2>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="970016"> </a>Most Palm Powered handheld screens are only 160x160 pixels, so the amount of information you can display at one time is limited. 
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970017"> </a>For this reason, you must design your user interface carefully with different priorities and goals than are used for large screens. Strive for a balance between providing enough information and overcrowding the screen. See the book <i>Palm OS User Interface Guidelines</i> for more detailed guidelines on designing the user interface. 
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970018"> </a>Note that screen sizes of future Palm Powered handhelds may vary. The Sony Clie already has a different screen resolution (320 X 320 pixels) than other Palm Powered handhelds although its screen is still the same size as other handhelds. The HandEra 330 has introduced the ability to rotate the display and the ability to collapse the input area. If the user collapses the input area, there is more space available to the application. 
</p>

<h2 class="HBHeadB">
  <a name="970019"> </a>Quick Turnaround Expected
<a href="#969980"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0"></a></h2>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="970020"> </a>On a PC, users don't mind waiting a few seconds while an application loads because they plan to use the application for an extended amount of time. 
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970021"> </a>By contrast, the average handheld user uses a handheld application 15 to 20 times per day for much briefer periods of time, usually just a few seconds. Speed is therefore a critical design objective for handhelds and is not limited to execution speed of the code. The total time needed to navigate, select, and execute commands can have a big impact on overall efficiency. (Also consider that Palm OS does not provide a wait cursor.)
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970024"> </a>To maximize performance, the user interface should minimize navigation between windows, opening of dialogs, and so on. The layout of application screens needs to be simple so that the user can pick up the product and use it effectively after a short time. It's especially helpful if the user interface of your application is consistent with other applications on the handheld so users work with familiar patterns. 
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970025"> </a>The Palm OS development team has put together a set of design guidelines that were used as the basis for the applications resident on the handheld (Memo Pad, Address Book, and so on). These guidelines are summarized in the book <i>Palm OS User Interface Guidelines</i>. 
</p>

<h2 class="HBHeadB">
  <a name="970027"> </a>PC Connectivity
<a href="#969980"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0"></a></h2>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="970029"> </a>PC connectivity is an integral component of the Palm Powered handheld. The handheld comes with a cradle that connects to a desktop PC and with software for the PC that provides "one-button" backup and synchronization of all data on the handheld with the user's PC. 
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970030"> </a>Many Palm OS applications have a corresponding application on the desktop. To share data between the handheld's application and the desktop's application, you must write a <b>conduit</b>. A conduit is a plug-in to the HotSync<sup>®</sup> technology that runs when you press the HotSync button. A conduit synchronizes data between the application on the desktop and the application on the handheld. To write a conduit, you use the Conduit SDK, which provides its own documentation. 
</p>

<h2 class="HBHeadB">
  <a name="970033"> </a>Input Methods
<a href="#969980"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0"></a></h2>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="972147"> </a>Most users of Palm Powered handhelds don't have a keyboard or mouse. Users enter data into the handheld using a pen. They can either write characters in the input area or use the keyboard dialog provided on the handheld. 
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="972148"> </a>While Graffiti<sup>®</sup> or Graffiti 2 strokes and the keyboard dialog are useful ways of entering data, they are not as convenient as using the full-sized desktop computer with its keyboard and mouse. Therefore, you should not require users to enter a lot of data on the handheld itself. 
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970036"> </a>Many Palm Powered handhelds support external keyboards, which are sold separately. Do not rely on your users having an external keyboard. 
</p>

<h2 class="HBHeadB">
  <a name="970038"> </a>Power
<a href="#969980"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0"></a></h2>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="970039"> </a>Palm Powered handhelds run on batteries and thus do not have the same processing power as a desktop PC. The handheld is intended as a satellite viewer for corresponding desktop applications. 
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970040"> </a>If your application needs to perform a computationally intensive task, you should implement that task in the desktop application instead of the handheld application. 
</p>

<h2 class="HBHeadB">
  <a name="970041"> </a>Memory
<a href="#969980"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0"></a></h2>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="970042"> </a>Palm Powered handhelds have limited heap space and storage space. Different versions of the handheld have between 512K and 8MB total of dynamic memory and storage available. The handheld does not have a disk drive or PCMCIA support.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970044"> </a>Because of the limited space and power, optimization is critical. To make your application as fast and efficient as possible, optimize for heap space first, speed second, code size third.
</p>

<h2 class="HBHeadB">
  <a name="970045"> </a>File System
<a href="#969980"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0"></a></h2>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="970046"> </a>Because of the limited storage space, and to make synchronization with the desktop computer more efficient, Palm OS does not use a traditional file system. You store data in memory chunks called <b>records</b>, which are grouped into <b>databases</b>. A database is analogous to a file. The difference is that data is broken down into multiple records instead of being stored in one contiguous chunk. To save space, you edit a database in place in memory instead of creating it in RAM and then writing it out to storage. 
</p>

<h2 class="HBHeadB">
  <a name="970049"> </a>Backward Compatibility
<a href="#969980"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0"></a></h2>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="970050"> </a>Different versions of Palm Powered handhelds are available, and each runs a different version of Palm OS. Users are not expected to upgrade their versions of Palm OS as rapidly as they would an operating system on a desktop computer. Updates to the OS are designed in such a way that you can easily maintain backward compatibility with previous versions of the OS, and thus, your application is available to more users. See <a href="Nutshell.html#970240">"Making Your Application Run on Different Devices"</a> for details. 
</p>

<h2 class="HaHeadA">
  <a name="970055"> </a>Palm OS Programming Concepts 
<a href="#969980"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0"></a></h2>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="970056"> </a>Palm OS applications are generally single-threaded, event-driven programs. Only one program runs at a time. To successfully build a Palm OS application, you have to understand how the system itself is structured and how to structure your application. 
</p>

  <a name="970063"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Each application has a <a href="SystemManager.html#1166472"><span style="font-family: monospace">PilotMain</span></a> function that is equivalent to <span style="font-family: monospace">main</span> in C programs. To launch an application, the system calls <span style="font-family: monospace">PilotMain</span> and sends it a <b>launch code</b>. The launch code may specify that the application is to become active and display its user interface (called a normal launch), or it may specify that the application should simply perform a small task and exit without displaying its user interface. </p>
<p class="Indented1"> <a name="970064"> </a>The sole purpose of the <span style="font-family: monospace">PilotMain</span> function is to receive launch codes and respond to them. (See <a href="AppStartupAndStop.html#971704">Chapter 2, "Application Startup and Stop."</a>)</p>

  <a name="970068"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Palm OS is an event-based operating system, so Palm OS applications contain an event loop; however, this event loop is only started in response to the normal launch. Your application may perform work outside the event loop in response to other launch codes. <a href="EventLoop.html#977418">Chapter 3, "Event Loop,"</a> describes the main event loop.</p>

  <a name="970072"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Most Palm OS applications contain a user interface made up of <b>forms</b>, which are analogous to windows in a desktop application. The user interface may contain both predefined UI elements (sometimes referred to as <b>UI objects</b>), and custom UI elements. (See <a href="UserInterface.html#979973">Chapter 4, "User Interface."</a>)</p>

  <a name="970078"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; All applications should use the memory and data management facilities provided by the system. (See <a href="Memory.html#995988">Chapter 5, "Memory,"</a> and <a href="FilesAndDatabases.html#998419">Chapter 6, "Files and Databases."</a>)</p>

  <a name="970085"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; You implement an application's features by calling Palm OS functions. Palm OS consists of several managers, which are groups of functions that work together to implement a feature. As a rule, all functions that belong to one manager use the same prefix and work together to implement a certain aspect of functionality. </p>
<p class="Indented1"> <a name="970086"> </a>Managers are available to, for example, generate sounds, send alarms, perform network communication, and beam information through an infrared port. A good way to find out the capabilities of the Palm OS is to scan the <a href="CompanionTOC.html#21895">Table of Contents</a> of both this book and <i>Palm OS Programmer's Companion</i>, vol. II, <i>Communications</i>. </p>
<div class="NINoteImportant"><hr>
  <a name="970094"> </a> <span style="color: #333;  font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline">IMPORTANT:  </span> The ANSI C libraries are not part of the Palm development platform. In many cases, you can perform the same function using a Palm OS API call as you can with a call to a ANSI C function. For example, the Palm OS provides a string manager that performs many of the string functions you'd expect to be able to perform in an ANSI C program. If you do use a standard C function, the code for the function is linked into your application and results in a bigger executable.

  <a name="970097"> </a>API Naming Conventions
<a href="#969980"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0"></a></h2>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="970099"> </a>The following conventions are used throughout the Palm OS API:
</p>

  <a name="970101"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Functions start with a capital letter.</p>

  <a name="970102"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; All functions belonging to a particular manager start with a two- or three-letter prefix, such as "Ctl" for control functions or "Ftr" for functions that are part of the Feature Manager.</p>

  <a name="970104"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Events and other constants start with a lowercase letter.</p>

  <a name="970106"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Structure elements start with a lowercase letter. </p>

  <a name="970108"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Typedefs start with a capital letter and end with "Type" (for example, <span style="font-family: monospace">DateFormatType</span>, found in <span style="font-family: monospace">DateTime.h</span>).</p>

  <a name="970110"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Macintosh ResEdit resource types usually start with a lowercase letter followed by three capital letters, for example tSTR or tTBL.

  <a name="970185"> </a>Writing Robust Code
<a href="#969980"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0"></a></h2>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="970186"> </a>To make your programs more robust and to increase their compatibility with the next generation of Palm OS products, it is strongly recommended that you follow the guidelines and practices outlined in this section. 
</p>

  <a name="970187"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Check assumptions</p>
<p class="Indented1"> <a name="970188"> </a>You can write defensive code by adding frequent calls to the <a href="ErrorManager.html#1103711"><span style="font-family: monospace">ErrNonFatalDisplayIf</span></a> function, which enables your debug builds to check assumptions. Many bugs are caught in this way, and these "extra" calls don't weigh down your shipping application. You can keep more important checks in the release builds by using the <a href="ErrorManager.html#1103684"><span style="font-family: monospace">ErrFatalDisplayIf</span></a> function.</p>

  <a name="970195"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Avoid continual polling</p>
<p class="Indented1"> <a name="970196"> </a>To conserve the battery, avoid continual polling. If your application is in a wait loop, poll at short intervals (for example, every tenth of a second) instead. The event loop of the Hardball example application included with your Palm OS SDK illustrates how to do this. </p>

  <a name="970198"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Avoid reading and writing to <span style="font-family: monospace">NULL</span> (or low memory) </p>
<p class="Indented1"> <a name="970204"> </a>When calling functions that allocate memory (<a href="MemoryManager.html#1133492"><span style="font-family: monospace">MemSet</span></a>, <a href="MemoryManager.html#1133188"><span style="font-family: monospace">MemMove</span></a> and similar functions) make sure that the pointers they return are non-<span style="font-family: monospace">NULL</span>. (If you can do better validation than that, so much the better.) Also check that pointers your code obtains from structures or other function calls are not <span style="font-family: monospace">NULL</span>. Consider adding to your debug build a <span style="font-family: monospace">#define</span> that overrides <a href="MemoryManager.html#1133188"><span style="font-family: monospace">MemMove</span></a> (and similar functions) with a version that validates the arguments passed to it.</p>

  <a name="970209"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Use dynamic heap space frugally</p>
<p class="Indented1"> <a name="970210"> </a>It is important not to use the extra dynamic heap space available on Palm units running 2.0 and higher unless it is truly necessary to do so. Wasteful use of heap space may limit your application to running only on the latest handhelds-which prevents it from running on the very large number of units already in the marketplace.</p>
<p class="Indented1"> <a name="970211"> </a>Note that some system services, such as the IrDA stack or the Find window, can require additional memory while your application is running; for example, if the unit starts to receive a beam or other external input, the system may need to allocate additional heap space for the incoming data. Don't use all available dynamic memory just because it's there; instead, consider using the storage heap for working with large amounts of temporary data.</p>

  <a name="970212"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Check result codes when allocating memory</p>
<p class="Indented1"> <a name="970213"> </a>Because future handhelds may have larger or smaller amounts of available memory, it is always a good idea to check result codes carefully when allocating memory. It's also good practice to use the storage heap (and possibly file streams) to work with large objects.</p>

  <a name="970214"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Avoid allocating zero-length objects</p>
<p class="Indented1"> <a name="970215"> </a>It's not valid to allocate a zero-byte buffer, or to resize a buffer to zero bytes. Palm OS 2.0 and previous releases allowed this practice, but later revisions of the OS do not permit zero-length objects.</p>

  <a name="970216"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Avoid making assumptions about the screen</p>
<p class="Indented1"> <a name="970217"> </a>The location of the screen buffer, its size, and the number of pixels per bit aren't set in stone-they might well change. Don't hack around the windowing and drawing functions. If you are going to hack the hardware to circumvent the APIs, save the state and return the system to that saved state when you quit.</p>

  <a name="970218"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Don't access globals or hardware directly</p>
<p class="Indented1"> <a name="970219"> </a>Global variables and their locations can change; to avoid mishaps, use the documented API functions and disable your application if it is run on anything but a tested version of the OS. Future handhelds might run on a different processor than the current one.</p>
<p class="Indented1"> <a name="970220"> </a>Similarly, don't hardcode references to cards. Although current Palm OS hardware provides only a single card slot, this may not always be the case. Thus, when calling functions that manipulate cards, such as Data Manager and file streaming functions, pass a variable that references the target card, rather than passing a hardcoded reference to card 0.</p>

  <a name="970221"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Built-in applications can change</p>
<p class="Indented1"> <a name="970222"> </a>The format and size of the preferences (and data) for the built-in applications is subject to change. Write your code defensively, and consider disabling your application if it is run on an untested version of the OS.</p>

<h2 class="HaHeadA">
  <a name="970224"> </a>Assigning a Database Type and Creator ID 
<a href="#969980"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0"></a></h2>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="970226"> </a>Each Palm OS application is uniquely identified by a four-byte creator ID. Assigning this same creator ID to all of the databases related to an application associates those databases with the application. The OS takes advantage of this; for instance, the launcher's Info panel uses the creator ID to calculate the total memory used by each application.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970228"> </a>Each database on the Palm Powered handheld has a type as well as a creator ID. The database type allows applications and the OS to distinguish among multiple databases with the same creator ID. For applications, set the database type to <span style="font-family: monospace">sysFileTApplication</span> (<span style="font-family: monospace">'appl'</span>). For each database associated with an application, set the database type to any other value (as long as it isn't composed entirely of lowercase letters, since those are reserved by Palm). Certain predefined types-such as <span style="font-family: monospace">'appl'</span> (application) or <span style="font-family: monospace">'libr'</span> (library)-have special meaning to Palm OS. For instance, the launcher looks at the database type to determine which databases are applications.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970229"> </a>Types and creator IDs are case-sensitive, and are composed of four ASCII characters in the range 32-126 (decimal). Types and creator IDs consisting of all lowercase letters are reserved for use by Palm Inc., so any type or creator ID that you choose must contain at least one uppercase letter, digit, or symbol<a href="#970232"><span class="Footnote">1</span></a>.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970233"> </a>To protect your application from conflicting with others, you need to register your creator ID with Palm, which maintains a database of registered IDs. To choose and register a creator ID, see this web page:
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970235"> </a><a href="http://www.palmos.com/dev/creatorid/">http://www.palmos.com/dev/creatorid/</a>
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970236"> </a>Note that you don't need to register database types as you do creator IDs. Each creator ID in effect defines a new space of types, so there is no connection between two databases with type 'Data' but with different creator IDs.
</p>
<div class="NINoteImportant"><hr>
  <a name="970237"> </a> <span style="color: #333;  font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline">IMPORTANT:  </span> Applications with identical creator IDs cannot coexist on the same handheld; during installation the new application will replace the existing application that possesses the same creator ID. Further, the new application could well corrupt any databases that were associated with the preexisting application. For this reason, all applications should have their own unique creator ID.
<hr>
</div>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970238"> </a>Finally, creator IDs aren't used only to identify databases. They are also used, among other things, when getting or setting application preferences, to register for notifications, and to identify features.

  <a name="970240"> </a>Making Your Application Run on Different Devices 
<a href="#969980"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0"></a></h2>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="970241"> </a>There are many different handhelds that run Palm OS, and each may have a different version of the OS installed on it. Users are not expected to upgrade the Palm OS as frequently as they would an OS on a desktop computer. This fact makes backward compatibility more crucial for Palm OS applications. 
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970242"> </a>This section describes how to make sure your application runs on as many handhelds as possible by discussing:

  <a name="970256"> </a>Running New Applications on an Older Device
<a href="#969980"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0"></a></h2>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="970257"> </a>Releases of the Palm OS are binary compatible with each other. If you write a brand new application today, it can run on all versions of the operating system provided the application doesn't use any new features. In other words, if you write your application using only features available in Palm OS 1.0, then your application runs on all handhelds. If you use 2.0 features, your application won't run on the earliest Palm Powered handhelds, but it will run on all others, and so on. 
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970258"> </a>How can you tell which features are available in each version of the operating system? There are a couple of way to do so:
</p>

  <a name="970264"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; The <i>Palm OS Programmer's API Reference</i> has a <a href="CompatibilityApdx.html#987591">"Compatibility Guide"</a> appendix. This guide lists the features and functions introduced in each operating system version greater than 1.0. </p>

  <a name="970268"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; The header file <span style="font-family: monospace">SysTraps.h</span> (or <span style="font-family: monospace">CoreTraps.h</span> on Palm OS 3.5 and higher) lists all of the system traps available. Traps are listed in the order in which they were introduced to the system, and comments in the file clearly mark where each operating system version begins. </p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970269"> </a>Programmatically, you can use the Feature Manager to determine which features are available on the system the application is running on. Note that you can't always rely on the operating system version number to guarantee that a feature exists. For example, Palm OS version 3.2 introduces wireless support, but not all Palm Powered handhelds have that capability. Thus, checking that the system version is 3.2 does not guarantee that wireless support exists. Consult the <a href="CompatibilityApdx.html#987591">"Compatibility Guide"</a> in the <i>Palm OS Programmer's API Reference</i> to learn how to check for the existence of each specific feature.

<h2 class="HBHeadB">
  <a name="970278"> </a>Backward Compatibility with PalmOSGlue
<a href="#969980"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0"></a></h2>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="970279"> </a>The PalmOSGlue library can help you maintain backward compatibility with earlier releases while still allowing you to use the latest set of APIs. PalmOSGlue provides backward compatibility for some of the user interface manager calls and the managers that enable localization and internationalization. 
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970280"> </a>PalmOSGlue can be used in any application that runs on Palm OS 2.0 and later. The library provides the latest support for localization features and for accessing internal UI data structures. Link your application with the library PalmOSGlue (<span style="font-family: monospace">PalmOSGlue.lib</span> or <span style="font-family: monospace">libPalmOSGlue.a</span>). 
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970283"> </a>When you use PalmOSGlue, you use the functions in the same way as described they are described in the <i>Palm OS Programmer's API Reference</i>, but their names are different. For example, <span style="font-family: monospace">TxtFindString</span> is named <span style="font-family: monospace">TxtGlueFindString</span> in PalmOSGlue. When you make a call to a glue function (for example, <span style="font-family: monospace">TxtGlue</span><i>Func</i>, <span style="font-family: monospace">FntGlue</span><i>Func</i>, or <span style="font-family: monospace">WinGlue</span><i>Func</i>), the code in PalmOSGlue either uses the appropriate function found in the ROM or, if the function don't exist, executes a simple equivalent of the function.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970287"> </a>To see a complete list of functions in PalmOSGlue, see the chapter <a href="PalmOSGlueLib.html#1386348">"PalmOSGlue Library"</a> of the <i>Palm OS Programmer's API Reference</i>. 
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970294"> </a>PalmOSGlue is a linkable library that is bound to your project at link time. It is not a shared library. PalmOSGlue will increase your application's code size. The exact amount by which your code size increases depends on the number of library functions you call; the linker strips any unused routines and data.

<a href="#969980"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0"></a></h2>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="970297"> </a>As a rule, all Palm OS applications developed with an earlier version of the Palm OS platform SDK should run error-free on the latest release. 
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970298"> </a>If you want to compile your older application under the latest release, you need to look out for functions with a changed API. For any of these functions, the old function still exists with an extension noting the release that supports it, such as V10 or V20.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="970299"> </a>You can choose one of two options:
</p>

  <a name="970300"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Change the function name to keep using the old API. Your application will then run error free on the newer handhelds.</p>

  <a name="970301"> </a><p class="B1Bullet"> &#8226; Update your application to use the new API. The application will then run error free and have access to some new functionality; however, it will no longer run on older handhelds that use prior releases of the OS.</p>
