connected organizer revolutionized the world of computing. The
concepts behind the Palm OS&reg; platform have a history
longer than the device itself. Before the advent of the Palm
Computing platform, Jeff Hawkins and others at a small start-up
called Palm Computing were developing software for handheld devices,
working with myriad hardware manufacturers to have them adopt the
vision of those at Palm Computing. When Jeff and the others finally
realized it would never happen, they opted to create the hardware
themselves. Years later, out of this primordial ooze of creativity,
the Pilot 1000 was born. Then came the Pilot 5000, the PalmPilotTM
Personal, the PalmPilotTM Professional, and the Palm IIITM connected
organizers. Companies started calling upon Palm Computing to partner,
and out of those relationships came upgrade cards, pager cards, the
IBM WorkPad, the Symbol SPT 1500 with integrated bar code scanner,
and the Qualcomm pdQ with integrated cellular phone. And the list
continues to grow. Within eighteen months, four products shipped from
Palm Computing, and over a million devices were sold. We knew we had
a solid and compelling platform that would be popular with
developers.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">The fundamental idea behind our strategy was
first to get a large installed base using the devices as personal
organizers, and then to focus on signing up developers to broaden
their usefulness. This was a very different approach than those of
our predecessors. They believed you needed thousands of partners and
a publicly accepted standard to attract a large body of users. A
million-plus users later, we have over ten thousand add-on software
and hardware developers, and more are signing up daily. They believe,
as we do, that the Palm OS&reg; platform represents a new,
exciting, and commercially compelling opportunity for companies like
themselves. This development community has been and will continue to
be an integral part of our success story.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Developers new to the platform will find that
the design philosophy that has made Palm's products such a success
with users is mirrored in our approach to development. One example is
that of minimalistic design. Palm's products have always been
designed with only the necessary pieces in mind. Never are arbitrary
frills thrown in just to make the device seem more appealing.
Instead, we implement features that people will actually use and that
are well suited to the constraints present on a small device. True to
the philosophy of the devices themselves, the Application Programming
Interface (API) has been written with simplicity and applicability to
a small device in mind. The functions are tweaked for instant
response to user input, easy synchronization and backup, and a
simple, consistent user interface in all applications. </FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">We believe that this book will greatly benefit
any Palm OS&reg; platform developer who follows the book's advice
on how to create the best application with the lowest development
cost. To quick-start your own application, you can use the sample
programs in the book as building blocks. We hope that they will
contribute to the fast development and superior performance of your
application-and, in turn, will help it contribute to the growth and
power of the Palm OS&reg; platform.</FONT>
