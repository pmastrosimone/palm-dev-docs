<P><FONT FACE="Times">By almost anybody's standard of measure, the
PalmPilot and other Palm devices are wildly successful. Everybody
loves them: users buy them faster than any other handheld, product
reviewers give them awards, and programmers, once they find the
platform, never want to leave.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">How do we account for this phenomenon? What
makes the Palm handheld such a great device? Simple. It's really
fast, it's cheap, it does almost anything you ask it to, and it can
fit in your shirt pocket. Combine that with loyal users and one of
the most ardent developer followings seen since the glory days of the
Mac, and you have all the elements of a whirlwind success. If you are
a programmer, the question you should really be asking yourself right
now is, "What do I need to know to join in the fun?" To find out,
keep reading.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">If you know C and you want to write
applications for Palm devices, then this is the book for you. It
doesn't matter if you own a Palm and are an avid user, or if you are
only now thinking about getting one. You can be a wretchedly poor
student who wants to mess around with a PalmPilot in your spare time
using free development tools, or a programmer in a Fortune 500
company who just got told that you have to write an application for
the 5,000 units the company is deploying in the field next
month.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">We have tried hard to make sure that there is
useful information for everyone, from beginning Palm programmers to
those of you who have already danced around the block with these
lovely little devices. If you want to write an application that reads
barcodes, we help you; if you want to write an application to deploy
a sales force, we show you what to do.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times"><I>Do You Need to Know
C++?</I></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">It doesn't hurt if you know C++, but it isn't
necessary, either. C is just fine for creating a Palm application.
C++ does come in handy if you are going to write a conduit (we will
talk more about that in minute). </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times"><I>Do You Need to Be a Desktop
Expert<BR>
to Write a Conduit?</I></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Writing a Palm application can be a two-part
adventure. You may want to create an application for the handheld
device and a desktop application that will talk to the Palm
application. If you want to write a conduit (the code that handles
the exchange of data between the Palm and the desktop), then you will
need to know about the desktop (Windows or Macintosh). We tell you
how to write the conduit, but not a lot about how to create a desktop
application. For that you will need some outside resources.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times"><I>Which Flavor Conduit Do You
Want-C++ or Java?</I></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">You can use either C++ or Java to write a
conduit. We discuss some of the issues and help you figure out which
path you want.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><A NAME="P46_2730"></A>This book shows you how
to create a Palm application and a conduit. It assumes that you have
the Palm OS documentation (available at the Palm Computing web site,
</FONT><A HREF="http://www.palmos.com/dev"><FONT FACE="Times"><I>http://www.palm.com/devzone</I>)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times">
and know where to find things in it. Before showing you how to create
an application, we also spend some time explaining the difference
between a good application and a bad one; in other words, we tell you
how to design for this platform.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times"><I>The Breakdown of the
Chapters</I></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Part I, <I>Palm-Why It Works and How to Program
It</I>, gives you the big picture. You learn about the devices, their
history, their development environments, and the right way to design
a Palm application. </FONT>

<P><A HREF="ch01.htm"><FONT FACE="Times"><I>Chapter&nbsp;1, The Palm
Solution</I></FONT></A>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">We happily admit that this chapter is
unabashedly partisan. Would you want someone who doesn't like the
Palm OS&reg; platform telling you about it? We also describe which
features can be found on which devices and what you can expect to see
in the future. </FONT>

<P><A HREF="ch02.htm"><FONT FACE="Times"><I>Chapter&nbsp;2,
Development Environments and Languages</I></FONT></A>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Here we show you the choices in development
environments and the range of languages you can use.</FONT>

<P><A HREF="ch03.htm"><FONT FACE="Times"><I>Chapter&nbsp;3, Designing
a Solution</I></FONT></A>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">We ruminate about the best way to design a Palm
application and offer you some advice. We end this chapter by showing
you the design of an application and its accompanying conduit that we
are going to create in the book.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Part II, <I>Designing Palm Applications</I>,
takes you inside a Palm application. We describe its structure, user
interface elements, and the Application Programming Interface (API)
for the various parts of the application. </FONT>

<P><A HREF="ch04.htm"><FONT FACE="Times"><I>Chapter&nbsp;4, Structure
of an Application</I></FONT></A>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">We take you through the whole cycle of a Palm
application, from the time it is launched by the user to the moment
it quits. </FONT>

<P><A HREF="ch05.htm"><FONT FACE="Times"><I>Chapter&nbsp;5, Forms and
Form Objects</I></FONT></A>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Here you'll learn how to create the various
user interface elements of the application-everything from buttons to
alerts, from lists to gadgets.</FONT>

<P><A HREF="ch06.htm"><FONT FACE="Times"><I>Chapter&nbsp;6,
Databases</I></FONT></A>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">We explain the unique way the Palm OS creates
data structures and stores data on a Palm device.</FONT>

<P><A HREF="ch07.htm"><FONT FACE="Times"><I>Chapter&nbsp;7,
Menus</I></FONT></A>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">We show you how to create menus and the items
in them. You also learn how to use Palm's Graffiti shortcuts and
which menus should be where.</FONT>

<P><A HREF="ch08.htm"><FONT FACE="Times"><I>Chapter&nbsp;8,
Extras</I></FONT></A>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">We cover a little bit of this and a little bit
of that in this chapter. The topics are tables, find, beaming, and
barcodes (for use with the Symbol SPT 1500, a Palm OS&reg; platform
handheld). </FONT>

<P><A HREF="ch09.htm"><FONT FACE="Times"><I>Chapter&nbsp;9,
Communications</I></FONT></A>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">This chapter gives you a detailed look at
communications on a Palm OS device, everything from serial to TCP/IP.
</FONT>

<P><A HREF="ch10.htm"><FONT FACE="Times"><I>Chapter&nbsp;10,
Debugging Palm Applications</I></FONT></A>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Last, but most important, we turn to the
crucial topic that is the bane of every programmer's
existence-debugging. We show you how to figure out what's wrong with
your code.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Part III, <I>Designing Conduits</I>, covers
conduits. Just as we created a Palm application, we do the same for
conduits. This section includes everything from a complete
description of the parts of a conduit to development platforms for
them and code walkthroughs. Unlike the other two sections, these
chapters build on each other and should be read in order.</FONT>

<P><A HREF="ch11.htm"><FONT FACE="Times"><I>Chapter&nbsp;11, Getting
Started with Conduits</I></FONT></A>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">We start once again with the bigger picture.
After we describe all the general things you need to know about
conduits, we finally turn to a small amount of code that forms the
shell of a conduit. </FONT>

<P><A HREF="ch12.htm"><FONT FACE="Times"><I>Chapter&nbsp;12,
Uploading and Downloading Data with a Conduit</I></FONT></A>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">This chapter takes you a step further, and you
see how to upload and download data between the desktop and the
conduit. </FONT>

<P><A HREF="ch13.htm"><FONT FACE="Times"><I>Chapter&nbsp;13, Two-Way
Syncing</I></FONT></A>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">In this chapter, we show you a conduit that
uses full-blown data syncing, with the exchange of data depending on
where it has last been modified. We also describe the various logic
problems you encounter with a device that can synchronize data on
various desktops.</FONT>

<P><A HREF="ch14.htm"><FONT FACE="Times"><I>Chapter&nbsp;14,
Debugging Conduits</I></FONT></A>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">We return to the topic of debugging, this time
of conduits.</FONT>

<P><A HREF="appa.htm"><FONT FACE="Times"><I>Appendix: Where to Go
From Here</I></FONT></A>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">This appendix lists Palm developers'
resources.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times"><I>How to Read This Book</I></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">There are a few standard approaches people use
to read a book on programming. </FONT>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="Times">The
   skip-through-and-read-what's-interesting approach</FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Times">The cover-to-cover approach</FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Times">The
   in-front-of-a-computer-trying-to-create-your-own-application
   approach</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><I>The skip-through approach</I></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">If you choose this approach, view Part I as
background information. This section is more essential for beginners
to the Palm OS&reg; platform than for old-timers. If you already
know which development environment you are going to use, you can
ignore Chapter&nbsp;2. If you want to understand the design decisions
we made in the sample application and what makes the difference
between a good and a bad Palm application, then you need to read
through Chapter&nbsp;3.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">You can skip around Part II or read its
chapters in order. In either case, don't wait too long to read
Chapter&nbsp;10. No matter what, read this chapter before you try to
create your own project.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Part III won't make much sense unless you read
it in order. Each chapter builds on the previous chapter.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><I>The cover-to-cover method</I></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">We didn't write the book in this order, but it
seemed like the right progression at the time.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><I>The in-front-of-a-computer
approach</I></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Anxious types should read the debugging
material before taking too deep a plunge into creating an
application. Otherwise, far be it from us to try to slow you down.
Get to it!</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">We have to take a moment here to talk about
both the name of this book, <I>Palm Programming: The Developer's
Guide, </I>and about Palm devices in general. If you are a loyal Palm
user, then you probably call it a <A NAME="P115_8292"></A>Pilot. So
does virtually everyone else on the planet, except the company that
makes them-<A NAME="P115_8381"></A>3Com. The producers of these dandy
devices want you to think of Palm not as a device, but as a platform,
the <A NAME="P115_8490"></A>Palm OS&reg; platform. They do this,
reasonably enough, so that you realize that all the following devices
use the same operating system, even though different companies make
and sell them:</FONT>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="Times">Pilot 1000, Pilot 5000</FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Times">PalmPilot Professional</FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Times">PalmPilot Personal</FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Times">Palm III</FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Times">IBM WorkPad</FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Times">Symbol SPT 1500</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Why 3Com went from the use of Pilot to Palm can
be summed up in one word-lawsuit. Lawyers for the French Pilot Pen
company contacted lawyers at 3Com and said, "Hey, Pilot is our name;
stop using it." So 3Com did. Now, while we could spend hours talking
about the questionable wisdom of letting a pen company tell a
computer company to throw away a wildly popular, highly recognized
trade name, that doesn't change our problem. People call them Pilots;
the company calls them Palm devices.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">As if the situation weren't interesting enough,
add the entrance of the lumbering giant, Microsoft. Noticing the
success Palm Computing was having with its popular devices,
Microsoft's leaders said, "Hey, we're going to make some, too, and
we're going to call them <A NAME="P125_9542"></A>PalmPCs." While
Microsoft eventually backed off from the name PalmPC to palm-sized
computers, the damage had already been done-the Palm name had been
compromised. Now we have to worry that people will not know whether
we are talking about a PalmPilot device or a Windows CE-based palm
device in this book. It's enough to make a writer cry.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">So here's our problem: we want to make the
folks at Palm Computing happy, and we want to make sure readers know
what we are talking about in the book from just looking at the title.
Our compromise solution was <I>Palm Programming</I>. We wrote this
book to last a long time, and we are betting our title on 3Com's
ability to move consumer attachment from the word Pilot to the word
Palm.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">At the time we went to press, the dust hadn't
settled yet; it wasn't clear whether 3Com would be successful in
wresting the Palm name away from Microsoft. If they are, the book has
the right name, and you picked up <I>Palm Programming</I> for the
right reasons. If Microsoft wins-not an unbelievable possibility,
however unhappy the concept makes us-then you may have picked up this
book thinking it would help you with the Microsoft Windows CE
programming of palm-sized devices. Sorry for the confusion.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">If you haven't already figured out that the
people at Palm Computing deserve an enormous amount of gratitude, we
will tell you now. Many people deserve our thanks, starting with
Maurice Sharp, head of Developer Technical Support (DTS) at Palm
Computing. He coordinated the dispersal of proof chapters and had the
fortitude to read the whole manuscript while managing all the rest of
his duties. Other DTS people who read the entire manuscript were
David Fedor, Cheri Leonard, Gary Stratton, Bruce Thompson, and Ryan
Robertson. Keith Rollin in Engineering also read the whole manuscript
and gave us great comments, especially about debugging tools. If you
have ever tried to do a technical review of a proof copy, you know
how much work this is. These folks went the extra mile and obviously
read on their own time (food spills are a sure-fire indicator of a
dedicated individual), and for this we thank them profusely. If this
book is useful to you, remember that these people had a great deal to
do with that.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Other people at Palm Computing reviewed
individual chapters in their own areas of specialty and gave us great
advice. These include some folks in Engineering: Dan Chernikoff (for
serial port communications), Bob Ebert, Roger Flores, Steve Lemke,
Kelly McCraw, Chris Raff, and Tim Wiegman. Three managers also took
time out of their schedules to make sure we covered enough of the
bigger picture. They are Daniel Pifko (HotSync Product Manager), Phil
Shoemaker (Tools Engineering Manager), and Bill Witte (OS/SDK Product
Manager). All these people read drafts of chapters and sent back tons
of useful technical comments, and we thank them.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">The Palm Computing staff also provided a lot of
technical assistance. We can't begin to say how nice it is to be able
to ask for technical help, ask questions, ask about problems, and get
answers, usually within a day or two. The folks at Symbol
Technologies also helped us out. Rob Whittle, Product Manager of the
SPT 1500, got us a beta unit of the SPT 1500 and gave many useful
comments and other help. </FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">We also recruited some readers to see if the
book would make sense. These readers included C programmers new to
the platform and people who might well know more about programming
the Palm than we do. This list of volunteers who deserve recognition
includes Stephen Beasley, Edward Keyes, J.B. Parrett, and Stephen
Wong. Edward Keyes offered especially insightful and thorough
comments.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Now, over to the publishing side of things.
Many thanks to our editor, Mark Stone. It was very nice to have an
editor who read and actually understood our writing. Mark time and
time again caught inconsistencies and sloppy descriptions and gently
told us when we were mumbling. For two authors who don't like
writing, Mark's competence and professionalism made the task almost
palatable.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">On the personal side of things, we have a few
people to thank as well. As always, we need to thank our children,
Nicholas, Alexander, and Nathaniel, who can never figure out why
either of us writes books. We also thank our friends and families,
who put up with our annoying tendencies to fade out of conversations,
be late, and be absolutely boring while we are writing. </FONT>
