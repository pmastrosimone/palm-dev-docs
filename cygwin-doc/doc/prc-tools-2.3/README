This file contains general information and pointers to other sources of
information about prc-tools, the collection of GCC and related tools for
programming in C and C++ targeting Palm OS devices.


INSTALLATION

On platforms for which binary packages have been produced, you can simply
install the binary in the usual way for that platform.  For details, see
<URL:http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/install/>.

On Microsoft Windows, prc-tools uses Cygwin (<URL:http://cygwin.com/>) as
a substrate.  You can use prc-tools from the Cygwin shell without doing
anything special.  To use it from an ordinary Windows command line, you
will need to add {Cygwin}\bin, where {Cygwin} is the directory in which
you installed Cygwin, probably C:\cygwin, to your PATH.  For details,
see <URL:http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/install/cygwin.html>.

See below for details of building prc-tools yourself.


USING THESE TOOLS

In addition to installing this package, you will also need to install
a Palm OS SDK.  SDK versions 3.5 and greater work with prc-tools without
modification.  Earlier SDKs require changes to work with prc-tools; in the
past it was possible to find suitably modified SDKs on Palm's Web site at
<URL:http://www.palmos.com/dev/tools/gcc/#sdks>, but they were no longer
available at the time of writing.

You may wish to install several SDKs, and you will probably want to choose
one as the default SDK, to be used when you compile without any "-palmosN"
command line option.  Use the palmdev-prep utility, which you should rerun
whenever you upgrade prc-tools or install new SDKs or other Palm OS development
material, to select a default and to teach GCC where to find SDKs.  See the
palmdev-prep section of the prc-tools documentation, which is also available
on the Web at <URL:http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/info/palmdev-prep>.


DOCUMENTATION

This package contains documentation in info format:  the prc-tools info
page gives an overview of the whole tool chain and Palm OS-specific details,
and the GCC, GDB, etc packages provide info pages that are also relevant.

The same documentation is also available in HTML format; you can install
the prc-tools-htmldocs package or read the manuals on the Web at
<URL:http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/doc/>.


QUESTIONS ABOUT PALM OS PROGRAMMING

Especially if you are new to C or new to programming for Palm OS, you may
find that you have questions about problems you encounter while using
prc-tools, and you may be unsure where to ask them.

For questions about C programming, we recommend starting with the comp.lang.c
FAQ, available at <URL:http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/C-faq/top.html>.

In general, Palm OS programming questions should be posted to palm-dev-forum
or pilot.programmer if they are related to Palm OS APIs etc generally
regardless of the tools in use, or to tools-forum or pilot.programmer.gcc
if they are specifically related to the use of GCC and prc-tools.

For the latter, see also <URL:http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/faq/>.

In order to post to palm-dev-forum or tools-forum you first need to subscribe
at <URL:http://www.palmos.com/dev/support/forums/>.  You'll also see several
other fora listed there; like tools-forum, they are more specific than the
general palm-dev-forum and should be used in preference to palm-dev-forum for
questions within their particular areas.

To post to pilot.programmer and pilot.programmer.gcc, just point your
newsreader to <URL:news://news.falch.net/>.  You'll also see several other
newsgroups listed there.

If you haven't participated in technical fora like these before, we also
recommend reading <URL:http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html>,
which will teach you how to present your information and questions so as to
maximise the likelihood of useful responses.


BUILDING FROM SOURCE

To build these tools yourself, you will need to download the source from
<URL:http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/>.  The prc-tools source contains
patches against specific versions of GCC, binutils, and GDB.  You will
also need the source code for these versions of these packages.

See the file BUILDING.html for details.  This file can be found in
the prc-tools source tarball and also on the Web at
<URL:http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/install/BUILDING.html>.


LICENSING

This is a summary of the terms under which you may redistribute the various
parts of prc-tools.  Of particular interest are the terms pertaining to the
library functions provided by prc-tools for linking with your Palm OS projects,
because they may have implications on the licensing terms available for your
project, if it contains (i.e. uses) a provided function or functions to which
particular terms apply.  (Many of these functions have been explicitly placed
in the public domain, so carry no such implications.)

For full details, you should of course consult the copyright and licensing
text in the relevant source files.

* The patches to the GNU tools in *.palmos.diff and the code in the tools
  subdirectory are free software, and may be redistributed and/or modified
  under the terms of the GNU General Public License, either version 2, or
  (at your option) any later version.  See the file COPYING.

* The run-time support code in the crt subdirectory is in the public domain,
  and the resulting object code may be freely linked into your programs.

* The C library code in the libc subdirectory has assorted licenses,
  as follows:

  various *.c files containing the functions declared in the headers
  ctype.h, stdlib.h, and string.h
	This code is in the public domain, and the resulting object code
	may be freely linked into your programs.

  conio.c
	Released under the LGPL v2 by Jeff Dionne, who described the routines
	provided as follows:  "putchar() and printf() send output to the LCD
	(even does scrolling!).  I would not expect this to be terribly useful
	for anything except debugging, or perhaps a terminal program."

  bcopy.c, vsprintf.c
	The licensing of this portion of the code in the libc subdirectory was
	described as follows by Jeff Dionne in the prc-tools 0.5.0 README:

	Much of this library thanks to Linus Torvalds, from the Linux kernel
	lib directory.  He gave me permission to release this stuff _without_
	GPL encumbrance.

* The code in the libm subdirectory is based on the Cephes Math Library
  <URL:http://www.moshier.net/#Cephes> and is freely redistributable
  as follows:

  libm.a
	Single precision math library.  The standard kind of stuff
	(like multiply, add etc) will be included with libgcc.a
	when the compiler was built, this stuff is what one expects
	from a complete libm.a.  This library was ported from
	the Cephes Math Library Release 2.2:  June, 1992 and is
	Copyright 1984, 1987, 1988 by Stephen L. Moshier.  Really
	neat stuff!

The prc-tools project home page is <URL:http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/>.
Discussion of further prc-tools development and maintenance takes place on
the prc-tools-devel mailing list, accessible via the home page.

(Note that discussion of Palm OS programming problems encountered while
using prc-tools is off-topic on prc-tools-devel; such questions are more
likely to receive knowledgeable answers on the more appropriate fora
listed above under "Questions about Palm OS Programming".)

Happy hacking!
