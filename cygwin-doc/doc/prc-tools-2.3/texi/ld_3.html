<H2> 2.1 Command Line Options </H2>
<!--docid::SEC3::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX3"></A>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
</P><P>

The linker supports a plethora of command-line options, but in actual
practice few of them are used in any particular context.
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
For instance, a frequent use of <CODE>ld</CODE> is to link standard Unix
object files on a standard, supported Unix system.  On such a system, to
link a file <CODE>hello.o</CODE>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>ld -o <VAR>output</VAR> /lib/crt0.o hello.o -lc
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This tells <CODE>ld</CODE> to produce a file called <VAR>output</VAR> as the
result of linking the file <CODE>/lib/crt0.o</CODE> with <CODE>hello.o</CODE> and
the library <CODE>libc.a</CODE>, which will come from the standard search
directories.  (See the discussion of the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option below.)
</P><P>

Some of the command-line options to <CODE>ld</CODE> may be specified at any
point in the command line.  However, options which refer to files, such
as <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-T'</SAMP>, cause the file to be read at the point at
which the option appears in the command line, relative to the object
files and other file options.  Repeating non-file options with a
different argument will either have no further effect, or override prior
occurrences (those further to the left on the command line) of that
option.  Options which may be meaningfully specified more than once are
noted in the descriptions below.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX6"></A>
Non-option arguments are object files or archives which are to be linked
together.  They may follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line
options, except that an object file argument may not be placed between
an option and its argument.
</P><P>

Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but you can
specify other forms of binary input files using <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-R'</SAMP>,
and the script command language.  If <EM>no</EM> binary input files at all
are specified, the linker does not produce any output, and issues the
message <SAMP>`No input files'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

If the linker cannot recognize the format of an object file, it will
assume that it is a linker script.  A script specified in this way
augments the main linker script used for the link (either the default
linker script or the one specified by using <SAMP>`-T'</SAMP>).  This feature
permits the linker to link against a file which appears to be an object
or an archive, but actually merely defines some symbol values, or uses
<CODE>INPUT</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP</CODE> to load other objects.  Note that
specifying a script in this way merely augments the main linker script;
use the <SAMP>`-T'</SAMP> option to replace the default linker script entirely.
See section <A HREF="ld_6.html#SEC6">3. Linker Scripts</A>.
</P><P>

For options whose names are a single letter,
option arguments must either follow the option letter without intervening
whitespace, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the
option that requires them.
</P><P>

For options whose names are multiple letters, either one dash or two can
precede the option name; for example, <SAMP>`-trace-symbol'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`--trace-symbol'</SAMP> are equivalent.  Note--there is one exception to
this rule.  Multiple letter options that start with a lower case 'o' can
only be preceeded by two dashes.  This is to reduce confusion with the
<SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> option.  So for example <SAMP>`-omagic'</SAMP> sets the output file
name to <SAMP>`magic'</SAMP> whereas <SAMP>`--omagic'</SAMP> sets the NMAGIC flag on the
output.
</P><P>

Arguments to multiple-letter options must either be separated from the
option name by an equals sign, or be given as separate arguments
immediately following the option that requires them.  For example,
<SAMP>`--trace-symbol foo'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`--trace-symbol=foo'</SAMP> are equivalent.
Unique abbreviations of the names of multiple-letter options are
accepted.
</P><P>

Note--if the linker is being invoked indirectly, via a compiler driver
(e.g. <SAMP>`gcc'</SAMP>) then all the linker command line options should be
prefixed by <SAMP>`-Wl,'</SAMP> (or whatever is appropriate for the particular
compiler driver) like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>  gcc -Wl,--startgroup foo.o bar.o -Wl,--endgroup
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This is important, because otherwise the compiler driver program may
silently drop the linker options, resulting in a bad link.
</P><P>

Here is a table of the generic command line switches accepted by the GNU
linker:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
<DT><CODE>-a<VAR>keyword</VAR></CODE>
<DD>This option is supported for HP/UX compatibility.  The <VAR>keyword</VAR>
argument must be one of the strings <SAMP>`archive'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`shared'</SAMP>, or
<SAMP>`default'</SAMP>.  <SAMP>`-aarchive'</SAMP> is functionally equivalent to
<SAMP>`-Bstatic'</SAMP>, and the other two keywords are functionally equivalent
to <SAMP>`-Bdynamic'</SAMP>.  This option may be used any number of times.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
<DT><CODE>-A<VAR>architecture</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX10"></A>
<DT><CODE>--architecture=<VAR>architecture</VAR></CODE>
<DD>In the current release of <CODE>ld</CODE>, this option is useful only for the
Intel 960 family of architectures.  In that <CODE>ld</CODE> configuration, the
<VAR>architecture</VAR> argument identifies the particular architecture in
the 960 family, enabling some safeguards and modifying the
archive-library search path.  See section <A HREF="ld_52.html#SEC52"><CODE>ld</CODE> and the Intel 960 family</A>, for details.
<P>

Future releases of <CODE>ld</CODE> may support similar functionality for
other architecture families.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
<DT><CODE>-b <VAR>input-format</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--format=<VAR>input-format</VAR></CODE>
<DD><CODE>ld</CODE> may be configured to support more than one kind of object
file.  If your <CODE>ld</CODE> is configured this way, you can use the
<SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> option to specify the binary format for input object files
that follow this option on the command line.  Even when <CODE>ld</CODE> is
configured to support alternative object formats, you don't usually need
to specify this, as <CODE>ld</CODE> should be configured to expect as a
default input format the most usual format on each machine.
<VAR>input-format</VAR> is a text string, the name of a particular format
supported by the BFD libraries.  (You can list the available binary
formats with <SAMP>`objdump -i'</SAMP>.)
See section <A HREF="ld_60.html#SEC60">5. BFD</A>.
<P>

You may want to use this option if you are linking files with an unusual
binary format.  You can also use <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> to switch formats explicitly (when
linking object files of different formats), by including
<SAMP>`-b <VAR>input-format</VAR>'</SAMP> before each group of object files in a
particular format.
</P><P>

The default format is taken from the environment variable
<CODE>GNUTARGET</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="ld_5.html#SEC5">2.2 Environment Variables</A>.
You can also define the input format from a script, using the command
<CODE>TARGET</CODE>;
see <A HREF="ld_13.html#SEC13">3.4.3 Commands Dealing with Object File Formats</A>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
<DT><CODE>-c <VAR>MRI-commandfile</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--mri-script=<VAR>MRI-commandfile</VAR></CODE>
<DD>For compatibility with linkers produced by MRI, <CODE>ld</CODE> accepts script
files written in an alternate, restricted command language, described in
<A HREF="ld_67.html#SEC67">MRI Compatible Script Files</A>.
Introduce MRI script files with
the option <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP>; use the <SAMP>`-T'</SAMP> option to run linker
scripts written in the general-purpose <CODE>ld</CODE> scripting language.
If <VAR>MRI-cmdfile</VAR> does not exist, <CODE>ld</CODE> looks for it in the directories
specified by any <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> options.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
<DT><CODE>-d</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-dc</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-dp</CODE>
<DD>These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are supported for
compatibility with other linkers.  They assign space to common symbols
even if a relocatable output file is specified (with <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>).  The
script command <CODE>FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION</CODE> has the same effect.
See section <A HREF="ld_14.html#SEC14">3.4.4 Other Linker Script Commands</A>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
<DT><CODE>-e <VAR>entry</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--entry=<VAR>entry</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Use <VAR>entry</VAR> as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your
program, rather than the default entry point.  If there is no symbol
named <VAR>entry</VAR>, the linker will try to parse <VAR>entry</VAR> as a number,
and use that as the entry address (the number will be interpreted in
base 10; you may use a leading <SAMP>`0x'</SAMP> for base 16, or a leading
<SAMP>`0'</SAMP> for base 8).  See section <A HREF="ld_11.html#SEC11">3.4.1 Setting the Entry Point</A>, for a discussion of defaults
and other ways of specifying the entry point.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
<DT><CODE>-E</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--export-dynamic</CODE>
<DD>When creating a dynamically linked executable, add all symbols to the
dynamic symbol table.  The dynamic symbol table is the set of symbols
which are visible from dynamic objects at run time.
<P>

If you do not use this option, the dynamic symbol table will normally
contain only those symbols which are referenced by some dynamic object
mentioned in the link.
</P><P>

If you use <CODE>dlopen</CODE> to load a dynamic object which needs to refer
back to the symbols defined by the program, rather than some other
dynamic object, then you will probably need to use this option when
linking the program itself.
</P><P>

You can also use the version script to control what symbols should
be added to the dynamic symbol table if the output format supports it.
See the description of <SAMP>`--version-script'</SAMP> in <A HREF="ld_40.html#SEC40">3.9 VERSION Command</A>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
<A NAME="IDX30"></A>
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>
<DT><CODE>-EB</CODE>
<DD>Link big-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX32"></A>
<A NAME="IDX33"></A>
<DT><CODE>-EL</CODE>
<DD>Link little-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX34"></A>
<A NAME="IDX35"></A>
<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--auxiliary <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_AUXILIARY field
to the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol
table of the shared object should be used as an auxiliary filter on the
symbol table of the shared object <VAR>name</VAR>.
<P>

If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you
run the program, the dynamic linker will see the DT_AUXILIARY field.  If
the dynamic linker resolves any symbols from the filter object, it will
first check whether there is a definition in the shared object
<VAR>name</VAR>.  If there is one, it will be used instead of the definition
in the filter object.  The shared object <VAR>name</VAR> need not exist.
Thus the shared object <VAR>name</VAR> may be used to provide an alternative
implementation of certain functions, perhaps for debugging or for
machine specific performance.
</P><P>

This option may be specified more than once.  The DT_AUXILIARY entries
will be created in the order in which they appear on the command line.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX36"></A>
<A NAME="IDX37"></A>
<DT><CODE>-F <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--filter <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_FILTER field to
the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table
of the shared object which is being created should be used as a filter
on the symbol table of the shared object <VAR>name</VAR>.
<P>

If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you
run the program, the dynamic linker will see the DT_FILTER field.  The
dynamic linker will resolve symbols according to the symbol table of the
filter object as usual, but it will actually link to the definitions
found in the shared object <VAR>name</VAR>.  Thus the filter object can be
used to select a subset of the symbols provided by the object
<VAR>name</VAR>.
</P><P>

Some older linkers used the <SAMP>`-F'</SAMP> option throughout a compilation
toolchain for specifying object-file format for both input and output
object files.
The GNU linker uses other mechanisms for this purpose: the
<SAMP>`-b'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`--format'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`--oformat'</SAMP> options, the 
<CODE>TARGET</CODE> command in linker scripts, and the <CODE>GNUTARGET</CODE>
environment variable.
The GNU linker will ignore the <SAMP>`-F'</SAMP> option when not
creating an ELF shared object.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX38"></A>
<A NAME="IDX39"></A>
<DT><CODE>-fini <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>When creating an ELF executable or shared object, call NAME when the
executable or shared object is unloaded, by setting DT_FINI to the
address of the function.  By default, the linker uses <CODE>_fini</CODE> as
the function to call.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX40"></A>
<DT><CODE>-g</CODE>
<DD>Ignored.  Provided for compatibility with other tools.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX41"></A>
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>
<A NAME="IDX43"></A>
<DT><CODE>-G<VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--gpsize=<VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP register to
<VAR>size</VAR>.  This is only meaningful for object file formats such as
MIPS ECOFF which supports putting large and small objects into different
sections.  This is ignored for other object file formats.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX44"></A>
<A NAME="IDX45"></A>
<A NAME="IDX46"></A>
<DT><CODE>-h<VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-soname=<VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_SONAME field to
the specified name.  When an executable is linked with a shared object
which has a DT_SONAME field, then when the executable is run the dynamic
linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by the DT_SONAME
field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX47"></A>
<A NAME="IDX48"></A>
<DT><CODE>-i</CODE>
<DD>Perform an incremental link (same as option <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>).
<P>

<A NAME="IDX49"></A>
<A NAME="IDX50"></A>
<DT><CODE>-init <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>When creating an ELF executable or shared object, call NAME when the
executable or shared object is loaded, by setting DT_INIT to the address
of the function.  By default, the linker uses <CODE>_init</CODE> as the
function to call.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX51"></A>
<A NAME="IDX52"></A>
<A NAME="IDX53"></A>
<DT><CODE>-l<VAR>archive</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--library=<VAR>archive</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Add archive file <VAR>archive</VAR> to the list of files to link.  This
option may be used any number of times.  <CODE>ld</CODE> will search its
path-list for occurrences of <CODE>lib<VAR>archive</VAR>.a</CODE> for every
<VAR>archive</VAR> specified.
<P>

On systems which support shared libraries, <CODE>ld</CODE> may also search for
libraries with extensions other than <CODE>.a</CODE>.  Specifically, on ELF
and SunOS systems, <CODE>ld</CODE> will search a directory for a library with
an extension of <CODE>.so</CODE> before searching for one with an extension of
<CODE>.a</CODE>.  By convention, a <CODE>.so</CODE> extension indicates a shared
library.
</P><P>

The linker will search an archive only once, at the location where it is
specified on the command line.  If the archive defines a symbol which
was undefined in some object which appeared before the archive on the
command line, the linker will include the appropriate file(s) from the
archive.  However, an undefined symbol in an object appearing later on
the command line will not cause the linker to search the archive again.
</P><P>

See the <SAMP>`-('</SAMP> option for a way to force the linker to search
archives multiple times.
</P><P>

You may list the same archive multiple times on the command line.
</P><P>

This type of archive searching is standard for Unix linkers.  However,
if you are using <CODE>ld</CODE> on AIX, note that it is different from the
behaviour of the AIX linker.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX54"></A>
<A NAME="IDX55"></A>
<A NAME="IDX56"></A>
<DT><CODE>-L<VAR>searchdir</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--library-path=<VAR>searchdir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Add path <VAR>searchdir</VAR> to the list of paths that <CODE>ld</CODE> will search
for archive libraries and <CODE>ld</CODE> control scripts.  You may use this
option any number of times.  The directories are searched in the order
in which they are specified on the command line.  Directories specified
on the command line are searched before the default directories.  All
<SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> options apply to all <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> options, regardless of the
order in which the options appear.
<P>

If <VAR>searchdir</VAR> begins with <CODE>=</CODE>, then the <CODE>=</CODE> will be replaced
by the <EM>sysroot prefix</EM>, a path specified when the linker is configured.
</P><P>

The default set of paths searched (without being specified with
<SAMP>`-L'</SAMP>) depends on which emulation mode <CODE>ld</CODE> is using, and in
some cases also on how it was configured.  See section <A HREF="ld_5.html#SEC5">2.2 Environment Variables</A>.
</P><P>

The paths can also be specified in a link script with the
<CODE>SEARCH_DIR</CODE> command.  Directories specified this way are searched
at the point in which the linker script appears in the command line.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX57"></A>
<A NAME="IDX58"></A>
<DT><CODE>-m<VAR>emulation</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Emulate the <VAR>emulation</VAR> linker.  You can list the available
emulations with the <SAMP>`--verbose'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-V'</SAMP> options.
<P>

If the <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> option is not used, the emulation is taken from the
<CODE>LDEMULATION</CODE> environment variable, if that is defined.
</P><P>

Otherwise, the default emulation depends upon how the linker was
configured.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX59"></A>
<A NAME="IDX60"></A>
<A NAME="IDX61"></A>
<DT><CODE>-M</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--print-map</CODE>
<DD>Print a link map to the standard output.  A link map provides
information about the link, including the following:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>
Where object files and symbols are mapped into memory.
<LI>
How common symbols are allocated.
<LI>
All archive members included in the link, with a mention of the symbol
which caused the archive member to be brought in.
</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX62"></A>
<A NAME="IDX63"></A>
<A NAME="IDX64"></A>
<A NAME="IDX65"></A>
<DT><CODE>-n</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--nmagic</CODE>
<DD>Turn off page alignment of sections, and mark the output as
<CODE>NMAGIC</CODE> if possible.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX66"></A>
<A NAME="IDX67"></A>
<A NAME="IDX68"></A>
<A NAME="IDX69"></A>
<DT><CODE>-N</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--omagic</CODE>
<DD>Set the text and data sections to be readable and writable.  Also, do
not page-align the data segment, and disable linking against shared
libraries.  If the output format supports Unix style magic numbers,
mark the output as <CODE>OMAGIC</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX70"></A>
<A NAME="IDX71"></A>
<DT><CODE>--no-omagic</CODE>
<DD>This option negates most of the effects of the <SAMP>`-N'</SAMP> option.  It
sets the text section to be read-only, and forces the data segment to
be page-aligned.  Note - this option does not enable linking against
shared libraries.  Use <SAMP>`-Bdynamic'</SAMP> for this.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX72"></A>
<A NAME="IDX73"></A>
<A NAME="IDX74"></A>
<DT><CODE>-o <VAR>output</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--output=<VAR>output</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Use <VAR>output</VAR> as the name for the program produced by <CODE>ld</CODE>; if this
option is not specified, the name <TT>`a.out'</TT> is used by default.  The
script command <CODE>OUTPUT</CODE> can also specify the output file name.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX75"></A>
<A NAME="IDX76"></A>
<DT><CODE>-O <VAR>level</VAR></CODE>
<DD>If <VAR>level</VAR> is a numeric values greater than zero <CODE>ld</CODE> optimizes
the output.  This might take significantly longer and therefore probably
should only be enabled for the final binary.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX77"></A>
<A NAME="IDX78"></A>
<A NAME="IDX79"></A>
<DT><CODE>-q</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--emit-relocs</CODE>
<DD>Leave relocation sections and contents in fully linked exececutables.
Post link analysis and optimization tools may need this information in
order to perform correct modifications of executables.  This results
in larger executables.
<P>

This option is currently only supported on ELF platforms.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX80"></A>
<A NAME="IDX81"></A>
<A NAME="IDX82"></A>
<A NAME="IDX83"></A>
<DT><CODE>-r</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--relocateable</CODE>
<DD>Generate relocatable output--i.e., generate an output file that can in
turn serve as input to <CODE>ld</CODE>.  This is often called <EM>partial
linking</EM>.  As a side effect, in environments that support standard Unix
magic numbers, this option also sets the output file's magic number to
<CODE>OMAGIC</CODE>.
If this option is not specified, an absolute file is produced.  When
linking C++ programs, this option <EM>will not</EM> resolve references to
constructors; to do that, use <SAMP>`-Ur'</SAMP>.
<P>

When an input file does not have the same format as the output file,
partial linking is only supported if that input file does not contain any
relocations.  Different output formats can have further restrictions; for
example some <CODE>a.out</CODE>-based formats do not support partial linking
with input files in other formats at all.
</P><P>

This option does the same thing as <SAMP>`-i'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX84"></A>
<A NAME="IDX85"></A>
<A NAME="IDX86"></A>
<DT><CODE>-R <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--just-symbols=<VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Read symbol names and their addresses from <VAR>filename</VAR>, but do not
relocate it or include it in the output.  This allows your output file
to refer symbolically to absolute locations of memory defined in other
programs.  You may use this option more than once.
<P>

For compatibility with other ELF linkers, if the <SAMP>`-R'</SAMP> option is

The specified archives are searched repeatedly until no new undefined

would not be able to resolve that reference.  By grouping the archives,
they all be searched repeatedly until all possible references are

been assigned to see if there any overlaps.  Normally the linker will
perform this check, and if it finds any overlaps it will produce
suitable error messages.  The linker does know about, and does make

<P>

The format of the table is intentionally simple, so that it may be
easily processed by a script if necessary.  The symbols are printed out,
sorted by name.  For each symbol, a list of file names is given.  If the
symbol is defined, the first file listed is the location of the
definition.  The remaining files contain references to the symbol.

The script command <CODE>INHIBIT_COMMON_ALLOCATION</CODE> has the same effect.
See section <A HREF="ld_14.html#SEC14">3.4.4 Other Linker Script Commands</A>.
<P>

The <SAMP>`--no-define-common'</SAMP> option allows decoupling
the decision to assign addresses to Common symbols from the choice
of the output file type; otherwise a non-Relocatable output type
forces assigning addresses to Common symbols.
Using <SAMP>`--no-define-common'</SAMP> allows Common symbols that are referenced
from a shared library to be assigned addresses only in the main program.
This eliminates the unused duplicate space in the shared library,
and also prevents any possible confusion over resolving to the wrong
duplicate when there are many dynamic modules with specialized search
paths for runtime symbol resolution.

limited form of arithmetic is supported for the <VAR>expression</VAR> in this
context: you may give a hexadecimal constant or the name of an existing
symbol, or use <CODE>+</CODE> and <CODE>-</CODE> to add or subtract hexadecimal
constants or symbols.  If you need more elaborate expressions, consider

<DD>These options control whether to demangle symbol names in error messages
and other output.  When the linker is told to demangle, it tries to
present symbol names in a readable fashion: it strips leading
underscores if they are used by the object file format, and converts C++
mangled symbol names into user readable names.  Different compilers have
different mangling styles.  The optional demangling style argument can be used
to choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.  The linker will
demangle by default unless the environment variable <SAMP>`COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE'</SAMP>

<DT><CODE>--allow-shlib-undefined</CODE>

<DD>Allow (the default) or disallow undefined symbols in shared objects.
The setting of this switch overrides <SAMP>`--no-undefined'</SAMP> where
shared objects are concerned.  Thus if <SAMP>`--no-undefined'</SAMP> is set
but <SAMP>`--no-allow-shlib-undefined'</SAMP> is not, the net result will be
that undefined symbols in regular object files will trigger an error,
but undefined symbols in shared objects will be ignored.
<P>

The reason that <SAMP>`--allow-shlib-undefined'</SAMP> is the default is that
the shared object being specified at link time may not be the same one
that is available at load time, so the symbols might actually be
resolvable at load time.  Plus there are some systems, (eg BeOS) where
undefined symbols in shared libraries is normal since the kernel
patches them at load time to select which function is most appropriate
for the current architecture. eg. to dynamically select an appropriate
memset function.  Apparently it is also normal for HPPA shared
libraries to have undefined symbols.

Add a directory to the runtime library search path.  This is used when
linking an ELF executable with shared objects.  All <SAMP>`-rpath'</SAMP>
arguments are concatenated and passed to the runtime linker, which uses
them to locate shared objects at runtime.  The <SAMP>`-rpath'</SAMP> option is
also used when locating shared objects which are needed by shared
objects explicitly included in the link; see the description of the
<SAMP>`-rpath-link'</SAMP> option.  If <SAMP>`-rpath'</SAMP> is not used when linking an
ELF executable, the contents of the environment variable
<CODE>LD_RUN_PATH</CODE> will be used if it is defined.
<P>

The <SAMP>`-rpath'</SAMP> option may also be used on SunOS.  By default, on
SunOS, the linker will form a runtime search patch out of all the
<SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> options it is given.  If a <SAMP>`-rpath'</SAMP> option is used, the
runtime search path will be formed exclusively using the <SAMP>`-rpath'</SAMP>

<DD>When using ELF or SunOS, one shared library may require another.  This
happens when an <CODE>ld -shared</CODE> link includes a shared library as one

<P>

When the linker encounters such a dependency when doing a non-shared,
non-relocatable link, it will automatically try to locate the required
shared library and include it in the link, if it is not included
explicitly.  In such a case, the <SAMP>`-rpath-link'</SAMP> option
specifies the first set of directories to search.  The
<SAMP>`-rpath-link'</SAMP> option may specify a sequence of directory names
either by specifying a list of names separated by colons, or by
appearing multiple times.

This option should be used with caution as it overrides the search path
that may have been hard compiled into a shared library. In such a case it
is possible to use unintentionally a different search path than the

Any directories specified by <SAMP>`-rpath'</SAMP> options.  The difference
between <SAMP>`-rpath'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-rpath-link'</SAMP> is that directories
specified by <SAMP>`-rpath'</SAMP> options are included in the executable and
used at runtime, whereas the <SAMP>`-rpath-link'</SAMP> option is only effective
at link time. It is for the native linker only.

For a native linker, the contents of the environment variable
<CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE>.
<LI>
For a native ELF linker, the directories in <CODE>DT_RUNPATH</CODE> or

Create a shared library.  This is currently only supported on ELF, XCOFF
and SunOS platforms.  On SunOS, the linker will automatically create a
shared library if the <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> option is not used and there are
undefined symbols in the link.
<P>

<DT><CODE>--sort-common</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX191"></A>
This option tells <CODE>ld</CODE> to sort the common symbols by size when it
places them in the appropriate output sections.  First come all the one
byte symbols, then all the two byte, then all the four byte, and then
everything else.  This is to prevent gaps between symbols due to
alignment constraints.

<DT><CODE>--split-by-file [<VAR>size</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>Similar to <SAMP>`--split-by-reloc'</SAMP> but creates a new output section for
each input file when <VAR>size</VAR> is reached.  <VAR>size</VAR> defaults to a
size of 1 if not given.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX193"></A>
<DT><CODE>--split-by-reloc [<VAR>count</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>Tries to creates extra sections in the output file so that no single
output section in the file contains more than <VAR>count</VAR> relocations.
This is useful when generating huge relocatable files for downloading into
certain real time kernels with the COFF object file format; since COFF
cannot represent more than 65535 relocations in a single section.  Note
that this will fail to work with object file formats which do not
support arbitrary sections.  The linker will not split up individual
input sections for redistribution, so if a single input section contains
more than <VAR>count</VAR> relocations one output section will contain that
many relocations.  <VAR>count</VAR> defaults to a value of 32768.

the output of some existing linker.  This switch requests <CODE>ld</CODE> to
use the traditional format instead.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX197"></A>
For example, on SunOS, <CODE>ld</CODE> combines duplicate entries in the
symbol string table.  This can reduce the size of an output file with
full debugging information by over 30 percent.  Unfortunately, the SunOS
<CODE>dbx</CODE> program can not read the resulting program (<CODE>gdb</CODE> has no
trouble).  The <SAMP>`--traditional-format'</SAMP> switch tells <CODE>ld</CODE> to not
combine duplicate entries.

times as necessary to locate multiple sections in the command
line.
<VAR>org</VAR> must be a single hexadecimal integer;
for compatibility with other linkers, you may omit the leading
<SAMP>`0x'</SAMP> usually associated with hexadecimal values.  <EM>Note:</EM> there

<DT><CODE>--warn-common</CODE>
<DD>Warn when a common symbol is combined with another common symbol or with
a symbol definition.  Unix linkers allow this somewhat sloppy practice,
but linkers on some other operating systems do not.  This option allows
you to find potential problems from combining global symbols.
Unfortunately, some C libraries use this practice, so you may get some
warnings about symbols in the libraries as well as in your programs.
<P>

There are three kinds of global symbols, illustrated here by C examples:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`int i = 1;'</SAMP>
<DD>A definition, which goes in the initialized data section of the output
file.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`extern int i;'</SAMP>
<DD>An undefined reference, which does not allocate space.
There must be either a definition or a common symbol for the
variable somewhere.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`int i;'</SAMP>
<DD>A common symbol.  If there are only (one or more) common symbols for a
variable, it goes in the uninitialized data area of the output file.
The linker merges multiple common symbols for the same variable into a
single symbol.  If they are of different sizes, it picks the largest
size.  The linker turns a common symbol into a declaration, if there is
a definition of the same variable.
</DL>
<P>

The <SAMP>`--warn-common'</SAMP> option can produce five kinds of warnings.
Each warning consists of a pair of lines: the first describes the symbol
just encountered, and the second describes the previous symbol
encountered with the same name.  One or both of the two symbols will be
a common symbol.

<DT><CODE>--warn-constructors</CODE>
<DD>Warn if any global constructors are used.  This is only useful for a few

detect the use of global constructors.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX211"></A>
<DT><CODE>--warn-multiple-gp</CODE>
<DD>Warn if multiple global pointer values are required in the output file.
This is only meaningful for certain processors, such as the Alpha.
Specifically, some processors put large-valued constants in a special
section.  A special register (the global pointer) points into the middle
of this section, so that constants can be loaded efficiently via a
base-register relative addressing mode.  Since the offset in
base-register relative mode is fixed and relatively small (e.g., 16
bits), this limits the maximum size of the constant pool.  Thus, in
large programs, it is often necessary to use multiple global pointer
values in order to be able to address all possible constants.  This
option causes a warning to be issued whenever this case occurs.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX212"></A>

<DT><CODE>--warn-once</CODE>

<A NAME="IDX217"></A>
<DT><CODE>--warn-section-align</CODE>
<DD>Warn if the address of an output section is changed because of
alignment.  Typically, the alignment will be set by an input section.
The address will only be changed if it not explicitly specified; that
is, if the <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command does not specify a start address for
the section (see section <A HREF="ld_18.html#SEC18">3.6 SECTIONS Command</A>).
<P>

<A NAME="IDX218"></A>
<A NAME="IDX219"></A>
<DT><CODE>--whole-archive</CODE>
<DD>For each archive mentioned on the command line after the
<SAMP>`--whole-archive'</SAMP> option, include every object file in the archive
in the link, rather than searching the archive for the required object
files.  This is normally used to turn an archive file into a shared
library, forcing every object to be included in the resulting shared
library.  This option may be used more than once.
<P>

Two notes when using this option from gcc: First, gcc doesn't know
about this option, so you have to use <SAMP>`-Wl,-whole-archive'</SAMP>.
Second, don't forget to use <SAMP>`-Wl,-no-whole-archive'</SAMP> after your
list of archives, because gcc will add its own list of archives to
your link and you may not want this flag to affect those as well.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX220"></A>
<DT><CODE>--wrap <VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Use a wrapper function for <VAR>symbol</VAR>.  Any undefined reference to
<VAR>symbol</VAR> will be resolved to <CODE>__wrap_<VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE>.  Any
undefined reference to <CODE>__real_<VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE> will be resolved to
<VAR>symbol</VAR>.
<P>

This can be used to provide a wrapper for a system function.  The
wrapper function should be called <CODE>__wrap_<VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE>.  If it
wishes to call the system function, it should call
<CODE>__real_<VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE>.
</P><P>

Here is a trivial example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void *
__wrap_malloc (int c)
{
  printf ("malloc called with %ld\n", c);
  return __real_malloc (c);
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If you link other code with this file using <SAMP>`--wrap malloc'</SAMP>, then
all calls to <CODE>malloc</CODE> will call the function <CODE>__wrap_malloc</CODE>
instead.  The call to <CODE>__real_malloc</CODE> in <CODE>__wrap_malloc</CODE> will
call the real <CODE>malloc</CODE> function.
</P><P>

You may wish to provide a <CODE>__real_malloc</CODE> function as well, so that
links without the <SAMP>`--wrap'</SAMP> option will succeed.  If you do this,
you should not put the definition of <CODE>__real_malloc</CODE> in the same
file as <CODE>__wrap_malloc</CODE>; if you do, the assembler may resolve the
call before the linker has a chance to wrap it to <CODE>malloc</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>--enable-new-dtags</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--disable-new-dtags</CODE>
<DD>This linker can create the new dynamic tags in ELF. But the older ELF
systems may not understand them. If you specify
<SAMP>`--enable-new-dtags'</SAMP>, the dynamic tags will be created as needed.
If you specify <SAMP>`--disable-new-dtags'</SAMP>, no new dynamic tags will be
created. By default, the new dynamic tags are not created. Note that
those options are only available for ELF systems.
