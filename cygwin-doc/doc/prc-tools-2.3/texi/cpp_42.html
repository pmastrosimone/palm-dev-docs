<H2> 1.9 Invoking the C Preprocessor </H2>
<!--docid::SEC42::-->
<P>

Most often when you use the C preprocessor you will not have to invoke it
explicitly: the C compiler will do so automatically.  However, the
preprocessor is sometimes useful on its own.
</P><P>

The C preprocessor expects two file names as arguments, <VAR>infile</VAR> and
<VAR>outfile</VAR>.  The preprocessor reads <VAR>infile</VAR> together with any other
files it specifies with <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP>.  All the output generated by the
combined input files is written in <VAR>outfile</VAR>.
</P><P>

Either <VAR>infile</VAR> or <VAR>outfile</VAR> may be <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, which as <VAR>infile</VAR>
means to read from standard input and as <VAR>outfile</VAR> means to write to
standard output.  Also, if <VAR>outfile</VAR> or both file names are omitted,
the standard output and standard input are used for the omitted file names.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX79"></A>
Here is a table of command options accepted by the C preprocessor.
These options can also be given when compiling a C program; they are
passed along automatically to the preprocessor when it is invoked by the
compiler.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`-P'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX80"></A>
Inhibit generation of <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>-lines with line-number information in
the output from the preprocessor (see section <A HREF="cpp_41.html#SEC41">1.8 C Preprocessor Output</A>).  This might be
useful when running the preprocessor on something that is not C code
and will be sent to a program which might be confused by the
<SAMP>`#'</SAMP>-lines.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-C'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX81"></A>
Do not discard comments: pass them through to the output file.
Comments appearing in arguments of a macro call will be copied to the
output before the expansion of the macro call.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX82"></A>
Try to imitate the behavior of old-fashioned C, as opposed to ANSI C.
<P>

<UL>
<LI>
Traditional macro expansion pays no attention to singlequote or
doublequote characters; macro argument symbols are replaced by the
argument values even when they appear within apparent string or
character constants.
<P>

<LI>
Traditionally, it is permissible for a macro expansion to end in the
middle of a string or character constant.  The constant continues into
the text surrounding the macro call.
<P>

<LI>
However, traditionally the end of the line terminates a string or
character constant, with no error.
<P>

<LI>
In traditional C, a comment is equivalent to no text at all.  (In ANSI
C, a comment counts as whitespace.)
<P>

<LI>
Traditional C does not have the concept of a "preprocessing number".
It considers <SAMP>`1.0e+4'</SAMP> to be three tokens: <SAMP>`1.0e'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>,
and <SAMP>`4'</SAMP>.
<P>

<LI>
A macro is not suppressed within its own definition, in traditional C.
Thus, any macro that is used recursively inevitably causes an error.
<P>

<LI>
The character <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> has no special meaning within a macro definition
in traditional C.
<P>

<LI>
In traditional C, the text at the end of a macro expansion can run
together with the text after the macro call, to produce a single token.
(This is impossible in ANSI C.)
<P>

<LI>
Traditionally, <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> inside a macro argument suppresses the syntactic
significance of the following character.
</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX83"></A>
<A NAME="IDX84"></A>
Use the <SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP> option when preprocessing Fortran code,
so that singlequotes and doublequotes
within Fortran comment lines
(which are generally not recognized as such by the preprocessor)
do not cause diagnostics
about unterminated character or string constants.
</P><P>

However, this option does not prevent diagnostics
about unterminated comments
when a C-style comment appears to start, but not end,
within Fortran-style commentary.
</P><P>

So, the following Fortran comment lines are accepted with
<SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>C This isn't an unterminated character constant
C Neither is "20000000000, an octal constant
C in some dialects of Fortran
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

However, this type of comment line will likely produce a diagnostic,
or at least unexpected output from the preprocessor,
due to the unterminated comment:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>C Some Fortran compilers accept /* as starting
C an inline comment.
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX85"></A>
Note that <CODE>g77</CODE> automatically supplies
the <SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP> option
when it invokes the preprocessor.
However, a future version of <CODE>g77</CODE>
might use a different, more-Fortran-aware preprocessor
in place of <CODE>cpp</CODE>.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`-trigraphs'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX86"></A>
Process ANSI standard trigraph sequences.  These are three-character
sequences, all starting with <SAMP>`??'</SAMP>, that are defined by ANSI C to
stand for single characters.  For example, <SAMP>`??/'</SAMP> stands for
<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>, so <SAMP>`'??/n''</SAMP> is a character constant for a newline.
Strictly speaking, the GNU C preprocessor does not support all
programs in ANSI Standard C unless <SAMP>`-trigraphs'</SAMP> is used, but if
you ever notice the difference it will be with relief.
<P>

You don't want to know any more about trigraphs.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX87"></A>
Issue warnings required by the ANSI C standard in certain cases such
as when text other than a comment follows <SAMP>`#else'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`#endif'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-pedantic-errors'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX88"></A>
Like <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP>, except that errors are produced rather than
warnings.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-Wtrigraphs'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX89"></A>
Warn if any trigraphs are encountered.  Currently this only works if you
have turned trigraphs on with <SAMP>`-trigraphs'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>; in the
future this restriction will be removed.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-Wcomment'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX90"></A>
Warn whenever a comment-start sequence <SAMP>`/*'</SAMP> appears in a <SAMP>`/*'</SAMP>
comment, or whenever a Backslash-Newline appears in a <SAMP>`//'</SAMP> comment.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX91"></A>
Requests both <SAMP>`-Wtrigraphs'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-Wcomment'</SAMP> (but not
<SAMP>`-Wtraditional'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-Wundef'</SAMP>). 
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-Wtraditional'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX92"></A>
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
ANSI C.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-Wundef'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX93"></A>
Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an <SAMP>`#if'</SAMP> directive.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-I <VAR>directory</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX94"></A>
Add the directory <VAR>directory</VAR> to the head of the list of
directories to be searched for header files (see section <A HREF="cpp_6.html#SEC6">1.3.2 The <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> Directive</A>).
This can be used to override a system header file, substituting your
own version, since these directories are searched before the system
header file directories.  If you use more than one <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> option,
the directories are scanned in left-to-right order; the standard
system directories come after.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP>
<DD>Any directories specified with <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> options before the <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP>
option are searched only for the case of <SAMP>`#include "<VAR>file</VAR>"'</SAMP>;
they are not searched for <SAMP>`#include &#60;<VAR>file</VAR>&#62;'</SAMP>.
<P>

If additional directories are specified with <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> options after
the <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP>, these directories are searched for all <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP>
directives.
</P><P>

In addition, the <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP> option inhibits the use of the current
directory as the first search directory for <SAMP>`#include "<VAR>file</VAR>"'</SAMP>.
Therefore, the current directory is searched only if it is requested
explicitly with <SAMP>`-I.'</SAMP>.  Specifying both <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-I.'</SAMP>
allows you to control precisely which directories are searched before
the current one and which are searched after.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`-nostdinc'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX95"></A>
Do not search the standard system directories for header files.
Only the directories you have specified with <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> options
(and the current directory, if appropriate) are searched.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-nostdinc++'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX96"></A>
Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard directories,
but do still search the other standard directories.
(This option is used when building the C++ library.)
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-remap'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX97"></A>
When searching for a header file in a directory, remap file names if a
file named <TT>`header.gcc'</TT> exists in that directory.  This can be used
to work around limitations of file systems with file name restrictions.
The <TT>`header.gcc'</TT> file should contain a series of lines with two
tokens on each line: the first token is the name to map, and the second
token is the actual name to use.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-D <VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX98"></A>
Predefine <VAR>name</VAR> as a macro, with definition <SAMP>`1'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-D <VAR>name</VAR>=<VAR>definition</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>Predefine <VAR>name</VAR> as a macro, with definition <VAR>definition</VAR>.
There are no restrictions on the contents of <VAR>definition</VAR>, but if
you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program you
may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect characters such as
spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.  If you use more than
one <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> for the same <VAR>name</VAR>, the rightmost definition takes
effect.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-U <VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX99"></A>
Do not predefine <VAR>name</VAR>.  If both <SAMP>`-U'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> are
specified for one name, the <SAMP>`-U'</SAMP> beats the <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> and the name
is not predefined.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-undef'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX100"></A>
Do not predefine any nonstandard macros.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-gcc'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX101"></A>
Define the macros <VAR>__GNUC__</VAR> and <VAR>__GNUC_MINOR__</VAR>.  These are
defined automatically when you use <SAMP>`gcc -E'</SAMP>; you can turn them off
in that case with <SAMP>`-no-gcc'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-A <VAR>predicate</VAR>(<VAR>answer</VAR>)'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX102"></A>
Make an assertion with the predicate <VAR>predicate</VAR> and answer
<VAR>answer</VAR>.  See section <A HREF="cpp_37.html#SEC37">1.5.5 Assertions</A>.
<P>

You can use <SAMP>`-A-'</SAMP> to disable all predefined assertions; it also
undefines all predefined macros and all macros that preceded it on the
command line.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`-dM'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX103"></A>
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a list of
<SAMP>`#define'</SAMP> directives for all the macros defined during the
execution of the preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives
you a way of finding out what is predefined in your version of the
preprocessor; assuming you have no file <SAMP>`foo.h'</SAMP>, the command
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

will show the values of any predefined macros.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`-dD'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX104"></A>
Like <SAMP>`-dM'</SAMP> except in two respects: it does <EM>not</EM> include the
predefined macros, and it outputs <EM>both</EM> the <SAMP>`#define'</SAMP>
directives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of output go to
the standard output file.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-dI'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX105"></A>
Output <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> directives in addition to the result of preprocessing.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-M [-MG]'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX106"></A>
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for <CODE>make</CODE> describing the dependencies of the main
source file.  The preprocessor outputs one <CODE>make</CODE> rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of
all the included files.  If there are many included files then the
rule is split into several lines using <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>-newline.
<P>

<SAMP>`-MG'</SAMP> says to treat missing header files as generated files and assume
they live in the same directory as the source file.  It must be specified
in addition to <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`-MM [-MG]'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX107"></A>
Like <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> but mention only the files included with <SAMP>`#include
"<VAR>file</VAR>"'</SAMP>.  System header files included with <SAMP>`#include
&#60;<VAR>file</VAR>&#62;'</SAMP> are omitted.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-MD <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX108"></A>
Like <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> but the dependency information is written to <VAR>file</VAR>.
This is in addition to compiling the file as specified---<SAMP>`-MD'</SAMP> does
not inhibit ordinary compilation the way <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> does.
<P>

When invoking <CODE>gcc</CODE>, do not specify the <VAR>file</VAR> argument.
<CODE>gcc</CODE> will create file names made by replacing ".c" with ".d" at
the end of the input file names.
</P><P>

In Mach, you can use the utility <CODE>md</CODE> to merge multiple dependency
files into a single dependency file suitable for using with the <SAMP>`make'</SAMP>
command.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`-MMD <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX109"></A>
Like <SAMP>`-MD'</SAMP> except mention only user header files, not system
header files.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-H'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX110"></A>
Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other normal
activities.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-imacros <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX111"></A>
Process <VAR>file</VAR> as input, discarding the resulting output, before
processing the regular input file.  Because the output generated from
<VAR>file</VAR> is discarded, the only effect of <SAMP>`-imacros <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>
is to make the macros defined in <VAR>file</VAR> available for use in the
main input.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-include <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX112"></A>
Process <VAR>file</VAR> as input, and include all the resulting output,
before processing the regular input file.  
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-idirafter <VAR>dir</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX113"></A>
<A NAME="IDX114"></A>
Add the directory <VAR>dir</VAR> to the second include path.  The directories
on the second include path are searched when a header file is not found
in any of the directories in the main include path (the one that
<SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> adds to).
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-iprefix <VAR>prefix</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX115"></A>
Specify <VAR>prefix</VAR> as the prefix for subsequent <SAMP>`-iwithprefix'</SAMP>
options.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-iwithprefix <VAR>dir</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX116"></A>
Add a directory to the second include path.  The directory's name is
made by concatenating <VAR>prefix</VAR> and <VAR>dir</VAR>, where <VAR>prefix</VAR>
was specified previously with <SAMP>`-iprefix'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-isystem <VAR>dir</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX117"></A>
Add a directory to the beginning of the second include path, marking it
as a system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment as
is applied to the standard system directories.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-x c'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`-x c++'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`-x objective-c'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`-x assembler-with-cpp'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX118"></A>
<A NAME="IDX119"></A>
<A NAME="IDX120"></A>
Specify the source language: C, C++, Objective-C, or assembly.  This has
nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions; it merely
selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none of these options,
cpp will deduce the language from the extension of the source file:
<SAMP>`.c'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`.cc'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`.m'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`.S'</SAMP>.  Some other common
extensions for C++ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does not
recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the most
generic mode.
<P>

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Previous versions of cpp accepted a <SAMP>`-lang'</SAMP> option
which selected both the language and the standards conformance level.
This option has been removed, because it conflicts with the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>
option.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`-std=<VAR>standard</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX121"></A>
<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
Specify the standard to which the code should conform.  Currently cpp
only knows about the standards for C; other language standards will be
added in the future.
<P>

<VAR>standard</VAR>
may be one of:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>iso9899:1990</CODE>
<DD>The ISO C standard from 1990.
<P>

<DT><CODE>iso9899:199409</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>c89</CODE>
<DD>The 1990 C standard, as amended in 1994.  <SAMP>`c89'</SAMP> is the customary
shorthand for this version of the standard.
<P>

The <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> option is equivalent to <SAMP>`-std=c89'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>iso9899:199x</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>c9x</CODE>
<DD>The revised ISO C standard, which is expected to be promulgated some
time in 1999.  It has not been approved yet, hence the <SAMP>`x'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>gnu89</CODE>
<DD>The 1990 C standard plus GNU extensions.  This is the default.
<P>

<DT><CODE>gnu9x</CODE>
<DD>The 199x C standard plus GNU extensions.
</DL>
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-Wp,-lint'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX123"></A>
Look for commands to the program checker <CODE>lint</CODE> embedded in
comments, and emit them preceded by <SAMP>`#pragma lint'</SAMP>.  For example,
the comment <SAMP>`/* NOTREACHED */'</SAMP> becomes <SAMP>`#pragma lint
NOTREACHED'</SAMP>.
<P>

Because of the clash with <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>, you must use the awkward syntax
above.  In a future release, this option will be replaced by
<SAMP>`-flint'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-Wlint'</SAMP>; we are not sure which yet.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`-$'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX124"></A>
Forbid the use of <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> in identifiers.  The C standard does not
permit this, but it is a common extension.
<P>
