<H3> 3.2.1 Multiple code resources and global data </H3>
<!--docid::SEC18::-->
<P>

The current implementation puts pointers to the code resources into the
application's global data, and uses those pointers in the code emitted
for each call in which the calling function and the called function are in
different sections.  This means that you must not attempt to call between
different sections when globals are not available.
</P><P>

In particular, all functions in your application called while processing a
launch code that doesn't give you globals must be in the main code section.
This always includes <CODE>PilotMain</CODE>, which is always called by the startup
code for all launch codes.
</P><P>

<A NAME="SEC19"></A>
<H4> Read-only data </H4>
<!--docid::SEC19::-->
<P>

Read-only data, such as string literals and other constant data, are put
into code sections rather than the global data section.  This saves global
data space, which is in short supply, and is valid since the data, just
like the code resources that contain them, are read-only.
</P><P>

When an item of read-only data has file or global scope, it will be placed
in the main code section.  When it is local to a function, it will mostly,
but not always, be placed in the same code section as that function.
</P><P>

GCC's optimizer will usually notice when a string literal (or other constant)
is identical to one which has been previously emitted, and will reuse the
storage previously emitted rather than reserving more space for a duplicate.
</P><P>

Thus, in the following example, when optimisation is on, the string literal
referenced from <CODE>bar</CODE> may well be in the <CODE>foosec</CODE> section, while
<CODE>bar</CODE> itself is in the main code section:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>const char *foo () __attribute__ ((section ("foosec")));
const char *foo () { return "hello world"; }
const char *bar () { return "hello world"; }
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The code emitted for such a reference is similar to that emitted for an
inter-section function call: when there is a data reference in which the
referring function and the referenced item of read-only data are in different
sections, the code emitted uses the item's code resource's pointer, which is
located in the application's global data.
</P><P>

This means that you must ensure that this sort of reference doesn't occur
when globals are not available.  Because this compiler optimisation (of
course) occurs only within a single translation unit, a sufficient (but not
necessary) way to ensure this is by placing functions which are in different
sections in different translation units (e.g., in separate <TT>`.c'</TT> files).
</P><P>

In particular, all read-only data referenced while processing a launch code
that doesn't give you globals must be in the main code section.  (Thus, in
the example above, <CODE>bar</CODE> is likely to crash if it is called during a
no-globals launch.)
</P><P>

This can be arranged in the following ways, amongst others:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Write functions used during no-globals launches so that they use read-only
data with file or global scope:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>const char greeting[] = "hello world";
const char *bar () { return greeting; }
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<LI>
Order the functions within a translation unit so that all functions in the
main code section are defined before any functions in other code sections.
Then any shared read-only data will be in the main code section.
<P>

(When an item of read-only data is reused, it will have been placed in the
same section as the function from which it was <STRONG>first</STRONG> referenced.
Thus, if the functions are ordered as described, all read-only data
referenced from the functions in the main code section will themselves be
in the main code section.  Any inter-section references to read-only data
must then be from functions in other named code sections.  But in order for
such a function to have been called, globals must be available; hence the
inter-section reference will be safe too.)
</UL>
