<!--docid::SEC48::-->
<P>

Here are the possible CPU types:
</P><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
1750a, a29k, alpha, arm, c<VAR>n</VAR>, clipper, dsp16xx, elxsi, h8300,
hppa1.0, hppa1.1, i370, i386, i486, i586, i860, i960, m32r, m68000, m68k,
m88k, mips, mipsel, mips64, mips64el, ns32k, powerpc, powerpcle,
pyramid, romp, rs6000, sh, sparc, sparclite, sparc64, vax, we32k.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Here are the recognized company names.  As you can see, customary
abbreviations are used rather than the longer official names.
</P><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
acorn, alliant, altos, apollo, apple, att, bull,
cbm, convergent, convex, crds, dec, dg, dolphin,
elxsi, encore, harris, hitachi, hp, ibm, intergraph, isi,
mips, motorola, ncr, next, ns, omron, plexus,
sequent, sgi, sony, sun, tti, unicom, wrs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The company name is meaningful only to disambiguate when the rest of
the information supplied is insufficient.  You can omit it, writing
just <SAMP>`<VAR>cpu</VAR>-<VAR>system</VAR>'</SAMP>, if it is not needed.  For example,
<SAMP>`vax-ultrix4.2'</SAMP> is equivalent to <SAMP>`vax-dec-ultrix4.2'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

Here is a list of system types:
</P><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
386bsd, aix, acis, amigaos, aos, aout, aux, bosx, bsd, clix, coff, ctix, cxux,
dgux, dynix, ebmon, ecoff, elf, esix, freebsd, hms, genix, gnu, linux-gnu,
hiux, hpux, iris, irix, isc, luna, lynxos, mach, minix, msdos, mvs,
netbsd, newsos, nindy, ns, osf, osfrose, ptx, riscix, riscos, rtu, sco, sim,
solaris, sunos, sym, sysv, udi, ultrix, unicos, uniplus, unos, vms, vsta,
vxworks, winnt, xenix.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

You can omit the system type; then <TT>`configure'</TT> guesses the
operating system from the CPU and company.
</P><P>

You can add a version number to the system type; this may or may not
make a difference.  For example, you can write <SAMP>`bsd4.3'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`bsd4.4'</SAMP> to distinguish versions of BSD.  In practice, the version
number is most needed for <SAMP>`sysv3'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`sysv4'</SAMP>, which are often
treated differently.
</P><P>

If you specify an impossible combination such as <SAMP>`i860-dg-vms'</SAMP>,
then you may get an error message from <TT>`configure'</TT>, or it may
ignore part of the information and do the best it can with the rest.
<TT>`configure'</TT> always prints the canonical name for the alternative
that it used.  GNU CC does not support all possible alternatives.
</P><P>

Often a particular model of machine has a name.  Many machine names are
recognized as aliases for CPU/company combinations.  Thus, the machine
name <SAMP>`sun3'</SAMP>, mentioned above, is an alias for <SAMP>`m68k-sun'</SAMP>.
Sometimes we accept a company name as a machine name, when the name is
popularly used for a particular machine.  Here is a table of the known
machine names:
</P><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
3300, 3b1, 3b<VAR>n</VAR>, 7300, altos3068, altos,
apollo68, att-7300, balance,
convex-c<VAR>n</VAR>, crds, decstation-3100,
decstation, delta, encore,
fx2800, gmicro, hp7<VAR>nn</VAR>, hp8<VAR>nn</VAR>,
hp9k2<VAR>nn</VAR>, hp9k3<VAR>nn</VAR>, hp9k7<VAR>nn</VAR>,
hp9k8<VAR>nn</VAR>, iris4d, iris, isi68,

pbd, pc532, pmax, powerpc, powerpcle, ps2, risc-news,
rtpc, sun2, sun386i, sun386, sun3,
sun4, symmetry, tower-32, tower.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Remember that a machine name specifies both the cpu type and the company
name.
If you want to install your own homemade configuration files, you can
use <SAMP>`local'</SAMP> as the company name to access them.  If you use
configuration <SAMP>`<VAR>cpu</VAR>-local'</SAMP>, the configuration name
without the cpu prefix
is used to form the configuration file names.
</P><P>

Thus, if you specify <SAMP>`m68k-local'</SAMP>, configuration uses
files <TT>`m68k.md'</TT>, <TT>`local.h'</TT>, <TT>`m68k.c'</TT>,
<TT>`xm-local.h'</TT>, <TT>`t-local'</TT>, and <TT>`x-local'</TT>, all in the
directory <TT>`config/m68k'</TT>.
</P><P>

Here is a list of configurations that have special treatment or special
things you must know:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`1750a-*-*'</SAMP>
<DD>MIL-STD-1750A processors.
<P>

The MIL-STD-1750A cross configuration produces output for
<CODE>as1750</CODE>, an assembler/linker available under the GNU Public
License for the 1750A. <CODE>as1750</CODE> can be obtained at 
<EM>ftp://ftp.fta-berlin.de/pub/crossgcc/1750gals/</EM>.
A similarly licensed simulator for
the 1750A is available from same address.
</P><P>

You should ignore a fatal error during the building of libgcc (libgcc is
not yet implemented for the 1750A.)
</P><P>

The <CODE>as1750</CODE> assembler requires the file <TT>`ms1750.inc'</TT>, which is
found in the directory <TT>`config/1750a'</TT>.
</P><P>

GNU CC produced the same sections as the Fairchild F9450 C Compiler,
namely:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>Normal</CODE>
<DD>The program code section.
<P>

<DT><CODE>Static</CODE>
<DD>The read/write (RAM) data section.
<P>

<DT><CODE>Konst</CODE>
<DD>The read-only (ROM) constants section.
<P>

<DT><CODE>Init</CODE>
<DD>Initialization section (code to copy KREL to SREL).
</DL>
<P>

The smallest addressable unit is 16 bits (BITS_PER_UNIT is 16).  This
means that type `char' is represented with a 16-bit word per character.
The 1750A's "Load/Store Upper/Lower Byte" instructions are not used by
GNU CC.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`alpha-*-osf1'</SAMP>
<DD>Systems using processors that implement the DEC Alpha architecture and
are running the DEC Unix (OSF/1) operating system, for example the DEC
Alpha AXP systems.CC.)
<P>

GNU CC writes a <SAMP>`.verstamp'</SAMP> directive to the assembler output file
unless it is built as a cross-compiler.  It gets the version to use from
the system header file <TT>`/usr/include/stamp.h'</TT>.  If you install a
new version of DEC Unix, you should rebuild GCC to pick up the new version
stamp.
</P><P>

Note that since the Alpha is a 64-bit architecture, cross-compilers from
32-bit machines will not generate code as efficient as that generated
when the compiler is running on a 64-bit machine because many
optimizations that depend on being able to represent a word on the
target in an integral value on the host cannot be performed.  Building
cross-compilers on the Alpha for 32-bit machines has only been tested in
a few cases and may not work properly.
</P><P>

<CODE>make compare</CODE> may fail on old versions of DEC Unix unless you add
<SAMP>`-save-temps'</SAMP> to <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>.  On these systems, the name of the
assembler input file is stored in the object file, and that makes
comparison fail if it differs between the <CODE>stage1</CODE> and
<CODE>stage2</CODE> compilations.  The option <SAMP>`-save-temps'</SAMP> forces a
fixed name to be used for the assembler input file, instead of a
randomly chosen name in <TT>`/tmp'</TT>.  Do not add <SAMP>`-save-temps'</SAMP>
unless the comparisons fail without that option.  If you add
<SAMP>`-save-temps'</SAMP>, you will have to manually delete the <SAMP>`.i'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`.s'</SAMP> files after each series of compilations.
</P><P>

GNU CC now supports both the native (ECOFF) debugging format used by DBX
and GDB and an encapsulated STABS format for use only with GDB.  See the
discussion of the <SAMP>`--with-stabs'</SAMP> option of <TT>`configure'</TT> above
for more information on these formats and how to select them.
</P><P>

There is a bug in DEC's assembler that produces incorrect line numbers
for ECOFF format when the <SAMP>`.align'</SAMP> directive is used.  To work
around this problem, GNU CC will not emit such alignment directives
while writing ECOFF format debugging information even if optimization is
being performed.  Unfortunately, this has the very undesirable
side-effect that code addresses when <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> is specified are
different depending on whether or not <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> is also specified.
</P><P>

To avoid this behavior, specify <SAMP>`-gstabs+'</SAMP> and use GDB instead of
DBX.  DEC is now aware of this problem with the assembler and hopes to
provide a fix shortly.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`arc-*-elf'</SAMP>
<DD>Argonaut ARC processor.
This configuration is intended for embedded systems.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`arm-*-aout'</SAMP>
<DD>Advanced RISC Machines ARM-family processors.  These are often used in
embedded applications.  There are no standard Unix configurations.
This configuration corresponds to the basic instruction sequences and will
produce <TT>`a.out'</TT> format object modules.
<P>

You may need to make a variant of the file <TT>`arm.h'</TT> for your particular
configuration.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`arm-*-linuxaout'</SAMP>
<DD>Any of the ARM family processors running the Linux-based GNU system with
the <TT>`a.out'</TT> binary format (ELF is not yet supported).  You must use
version 2.8.1.0.7 or later of the GNU/Linux binutils, which you can download
from <TT>`sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/GCC'</TT> and other mirror sites for
Linux-based GNU systems.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`arm-*-riscix'</SAMP>
<DD>The ARM2 or ARM3 processor running RISC iX, Acorn's port of BSD Unix.
If you are running a version of RISC iX prior to 1.2 then you must
specify the version number during configuration.  Note that the
assembler shipped with RISC iX does not support stabs debugging
information; a new version of the assembler, with stabs support
included, is now available from Acorn and via ftp
<TT>`ftp.acorn.com:/pub/riscix/as+xterm.tar.Z'</TT>.  To enable stabs
debugging, pass <SAMP>`--with-gnu-as'</SAMP> to configure.
<P>

You will need to install GNU <TT>`sed'</TT> before you can run configure.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`a29k'</SAMP>
<DD>AMD Am29k-family processors.  These are normally used in embedded
applications.  There are no standard Unix configurations.
This configuration
corresponds to AMD's standard calling sequence and binary interface
and is compatible with other 29k tools.
<P>

You may need to make a variant of the file <TT>`a29k.h'</TT> for your
particular configuration.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`a29k-*-bsd'</SAMP>
<DD>AMD Am29050 used in a system running a variant of BSD Unix.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`decstation-*'</SAMP>
<DD>MIPS-based DECstations can support three different personalities:
Ultrix, DEC OSF/1, and OSF/rose.  (Alpha-based DECstation products have
a configuration name beginning with <SAMP>`alpha-dec'</SAMP>.)  To configure GCC
for these platforms use the following configurations:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`decstation-ultrix'</SAMP>
<DD>Ultrix configuration.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`decstation-osf1'</SAMP>
<DD>Dec's version of OSF/1.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`decstation-osfrose'</SAMP>
<DD>Open Software Foundation reference port of OSF/1 which uses the
OSF/rose object file format instead of ECOFF.  Normally, you
would not select this configuration.
</DL>
<P>

The MIPS C compiler needs to be told to increase its table size
for switch statements with the <SAMP>`-Wf,-XNg1500'</SAMP> option in
order to compile <TT>`cp/parse.c'</TT>.  If you use the <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP>
optimization option, you also need to use <SAMP>`-Olimit 3000'</SAMP>.
Both of these options are automatically generated in the
<TT>`Makefile'</TT> that the shell script <TT>`configure'</TT> builds.
If you override the <CODE>CC</CODE> make variable and use the MIPS
compilers, you may need to add <SAMP>`-Wf,-XNg1500 -Olimit 3000'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`elxsi-elxsi-bsd'</SAMP>
<DD>The Elxsi's C compiler has known limitations that prevent it from
compiling GNU C.  Please contact <CODE>mrs@cygnus.com</CODE> for more details.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`dsp16xx'</SAMP>
<DD>A port to the AT&#38;T DSP1610 family of processors.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`h8300-*-*'</SAMP>
<DD>Hitachi H8/300 series of processors.
<P>

The calling convention and structure layout has changed in release 2.6.
All code must be recompiled.  The calling convention now passes the
first three arguments in function calls in registers.  Structures are no
longer a multiple of 2 bytes.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`hppa*-*-*'</SAMP>
<DD>There are several variants of the HP-PA processor which run a variety
of operating systems.  GNU CC must be configured to use the correct
processor type and operating system, or GNU CC will not function correctly.
The easiest way to handle this problem is to <EM>not</EM> specify a target
when configuring GNU CC, the <TT>`configure'</TT> script will try to automatically
determine the right processor type and operating system.
<P>

<SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> does not work on HP-UX, since that system uses a peculiar
debugging format which GNU CC does not know about.  However, <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP>
will work if you also use GAS and GDB in conjunction with GCC.  We
highly recommend using GAS for all HP-PA configurations.
</P><P>

You should be using GAS-2.6 (or later) along with GDB-4.16 (or later).  These
can be retrieved from all the traditional GNU ftp archive sites.
</P><P>

On some versions of HP-UX, you will need to install GNU <TT>`sed'</TT>.
</P><P>

You will need to be install GAS into a directory before <CODE>/bin</CODE>,
<CODE>/usr/bin</CODE>, and <CODE>/usr/ccs/bin</CODE> in your search path.  You
should install GAS before you build GNU CC.
</P><P>

To enable debugging, you must configure GNU CC with the <SAMP>`--with-gnu-as'</SAMP>
option before building.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`i370-*-*'</SAMP>
<DD>This port is very preliminary and has many known bugs.  We hope to
have a higher-quality port for this machine soon.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`i386-*-linux-gnuoldld'</SAMP>
<DD>Use this configuration to generate <TT>`a.out'</TT> binaries on Linux-based
GNU systems if you do not have gas/binutils version 2.5.2 or later
installed. This is an obsolete configuration.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`i386-*-linux-gnuaout'</SAMP>
<DD>Use this configuration to generate <TT>`a.out'</TT> binaries on Linux-based
GNU systems. This configuration is being superseded. You must use
gas/binutils version 2.5.2 or later.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`i386-*-linux-gnu'</SAMP>
<DD>Use this configuration to generate ELF binaries on Linux-based GNU
systems.  You must use gas/binutils version 2.5.2 or later.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`i386-*-sco'</SAMP>
<DD>Compilation with RCC is recommended.  Also, it may be a good idea to
link with GNU malloc instead of the malloc that comes with the system.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`i386-*-sco3.2v4'</SAMP>
<DD>Use this configuration for SCO release 3.2 version 4.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`i386-*-sco3.2v5*'</SAMP>
<DD>Use this for the SCO OpenServer Release family including 5.0.0, 5.0.2, 
5.0.4, 5.0.5, Internet FastStart 1.0, and Internet FastStart 1.1.
<P>

GNU CC can generate COFF binaries if you specify <SAMP>`-mcoff'</SAMP> or ELF
binaries, the default.    A full <SAMP>`make bootstrap'</SAMP> is recommended
so that an ELF compiler that builds ELF is generated.                   
</P><P>

You must have TLS597 from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.sco.com/TLS">ftp://ftp.sco.com/TLS</A> installed for ELF
C++ binaries to work correctly on releases before 5.0.4. 
</P><P>

The native SCO assembler that is provided with the OS at no charge
is normally required.  If, however, you must be able to use the GNU
assembler (perhaps you have complex asms) you must configure this
package <SAMP>`--with-gnu-as'</SAMP>.  To do this, install (cp or symlink)
gcc/as to your copy of the GNU assembler.  You must use a recent version
of GNU binutils; version 2.9.1 seems to work well.  If you select this
option, you will be unable to build COFF images.  Trying to do so will
result in non-obvious failures.  In general, the "--with-gnu-as" option
isn't as well tested as the native assembler.
</P><P>

<EM>NOTE:</EM> If you are building C++, you must follow the instructions
about invoking <SAMP>`make bootstrap'</SAMP> because the native OpenServer
compiler may build a <TT>`cc1plus'</TT> that will not correctly parse many
valid C++ programs.  You must do a <SAMP>`make bootstrap'</SAMP> if you are
building with the native compiler.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`i386-*-isc'</SAMP>
<DD>It may be a good idea to link with GNU malloc instead of the malloc that
comes with the system.
<P>

In ISC version 4.1, <TT>`sed'</TT> core dumps when building
<TT>`deduced.h'</TT>.  Use the version of <TT>`sed'</TT> from version 4.0.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`i386-*-esix'</SAMP>
<DD>It may be good idea to link with GNU malloc instead of the malloc that
comes with the system.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`i386-ibm-aix'</SAMP>
<DD>You need to use GAS version 2.1 or later, and LD from
GNU binutils version 2.2 or later.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`i386-sequent-bsd'</SAMP>
<DD>Go to the Berkeley universe before compiling.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`i386-sequent-ptx1*'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`i386-sequent-ptx2*'</SAMP>
<DD>You must install GNU <TT>`sed'</TT> before running <TT>`configure'</TT>.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`i386-sun-sunos4'</SAMP>
<DD>You may find that you need another version of GNU CC to begin
bootstrapping with, since the current version when built with the
system's own compiler seems to get an infinite loop compiling part of
<TT>`libgcc2.c'</TT>.  GNU CC version 2 compiled with GNU CC (any version)
seems not to have this problem.
<P>

See <A HREF="gcc_57.html#SEC57">3.5 Installing GNU CC on the Sun</A>, for information on installing GNU CC on Sun
systems.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`i[345]86-*-winnt3.5'</SAMP>
<DD>This version requires a GAS that has not yet been released.  Until it
is, you can get a prebuilt binary version via anonymous ftp from
<TT>`cs.washington.edu:pub/gnat'</TT> or <TT>`cs.nyu.edu:pub/gnat'</TT>. You
must also use the Microsoft header files from the Windows NT 3.5 SDK.
Find these on the CDROM in the <TT>`/mstools/h'</TT> directory dated 9/4/94.  You
must use a fixed version of Microsoft linker made especially for NT 3.5,
which is also is available on the NT 3.5 SDK CDROM.  If you do not have
this linker, can you also use the linker from Visual C/C++ 1.0 or 2.0.
<P>

Installing GNU CC for NT builds a wrapper linker, called <TT>`ld.exe'</TT>,
which mimics the behaviour of Unix <TT>`ld'</TT> in the specification of
libraries (<SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>).  <TT>`ld.exe'</TT> looks for both Unix
and Microsoft named libraries.  For example, if you specify
<SAMP>`-lfoo'</SAMP>, <TT>`ld.exe'</TT> will look first for <TT>`libfoo.a'</TT>
and then for <TT>`foo.lib'</TT>.
</P><P>

You may install GNU CC for Windows NT in one of two ways, depending on
whether or not you have a Unix-like shell and various Unix-like
utilities.
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>
If you do not have a Unix-like shell and few Unix-like utilities, you
will use a DOS style batch script called <TT>`configure.bat'</TT>.  Invoke
it as <CODE>configure winnt</CODE> from an MSDOS console window or from the
program manager dialog box.  <TT>`configure.bat'</TT> assumes you have
already installed and have in your path a Unix-like <TT>`sed'</TT> program
which is used to create a working <TT>`Makefile'</TT> from <TT>`Makefile.in'</TT>.
<P>

<TT>`Makefile'</TT> uses the Microsoft Nmake program maintenance utility and
the Visual C/C++ V8.00 compiler to build GNU CC.  You need only have the
utilities <TT>`sed'</TT> and <TT>`touch'</TT> to use this installation method,
which only automatically builds the compiler itself.  You must then
examine what <TT>`fixinc.winnt'</TT> does, edit the header files by hand and
build <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT> manually.
</P><P>

<LI>
The second type of installation assumes you are running a Unix-like
shell, have a complete suite of Unix-like utilities in your path, and
have a previous version of GNU CC already installed, either through
building it via the above installation method or acquiring a pre-built
binary.  In this case, use the <TT>`configure'</TT> script in the normal
fashion.
</OL>
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`i860-intel-osf1'</SAMP>
<DD>This is the Paragon.
If you have version 1.0 of the operating system,
see <A HREF="gcc_125.html#SEC125">7.2 Installation Problems</A>, for special things you need to do to
compensate for peculiarities in the system.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`*-lynx-lynxos'</SAMP>
<DD>LynxOS 2.2 and earlier comes with GNU CC 1.x already installed as
<TT>`/bin/gcc'</TT>.  You should compile with this instead of <TT>`/bin/cc'</TT>.
You can tell GNU CC to use the GNU assembler and linker, by specifying
<SAMP>`--with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld'</SAMP> when configuring.  These will produce
COFF format object files and executables;  otherwise GNU CC will use the
installed tools, which produce <TT>`a.out'</TT> format executables.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`m32r-*-elf'</SAMP>
<DD>Mitsubishi M32R processor.
This configuration is intended for embedded systems.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`m68000-hp-bsd'</SAMP>
<DD>HP 9000 series 200 running BSD.  Note that the C compiler that comes
with this system cannot compile GNU CC; contact <CODE>law@cygnus.com</CODE>
to get binaries of GNU CC for bootstrapping.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`m68k-altos'</SAMP>
<DD>Altos 3068.  You must use the GNU assembler, linker and debugger.
Also, you must fix a kernel bug.  Details in the file <TT>`README.ALTOS'</TT>.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`m68k-apple-aux'</SAMP>
<DD>Apple Macintosh running A/UX.

The Unos assembler is named <CODE>casm</CODE> instead of <CODE>as</CODE>.  For some
strange reason linking <TT>`/bin/as'</TT> to <TT>`/bin/casm'</TT> changes the

When compiling GNU CC with the standard compiler, to overcome bugs in
the support of <CODE>alloca</CODE>, do not use <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> when making stage 2.
Then use the stage 2 compiler with <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> to make the stage 3
compiler.  This compiler will have the same characteristics as the usual
stage 2 compiler on other systems.  Use it to make a stage 4 compiler
and compare that with stage 3 to verify proper compilation.

Unos uses memory segmentation instead of demand paging, so you will need

In addition, if you wish to use gas <SAMP>`--with-gnu-as'</SAMP> you must use

MIPS computers running RISC-OS can support four different
personalities: default, BSD 4.3, System V.3, and System V.4
(older versions of RISC-OS don't support V.4).  To configure GCC
for these platforms use the following configurations:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`mips-mips-riscos<CODE>rev</CODE>'</SAMP>
<DD>Default configuration for RISC-OS, revision <CODE>rev</CODE>.

<DD>System V.3 configuration for RISC-OS, revision <CODE>rev</CODE>.
</DL>
<P>

The revision <CODE>rev</CODE> mentioned above is the revision of
RISC-OS to use.  You must reconfigure GCC when going from a
RISC-OS revision 4 to RISC-OS revision 5.  This has the effect of
avoiding a linker
bug (see <A HREF="gcc_125.html#SEC125">7.2 Installation Problems</A>, for more details).
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`mips-sgi-*'</SAMP>
<DD>In order to compile GCC on an SGI running IRIX 4, the "c.hdr.lib"

<P>

In order to compile GCC on an SGI running IRIX 5, the "compiler_dev.hdr"
subsystem must be installed from the IDO CD-ROM supplied by Silicon
Graphics.
</P><P>

<CODE>make compare</CODE> may fail on version 5 of IRIX unless you add
<SAMP>`-save-temps'</SAMP> to <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>.  On these systems, the name of the
assembler input file is stored in the object file, and that makes
comparison fail if it differs between the <CODE>stage1</CODE> and
<CODE>stage2</CODE> compilations.  The option <SAMP>`-save-temps'</SAMP> forces a
fixed name to be used for the assembler input file, instead of a
randomly chosen name in <TT>`/tmp'</TT>.  Do not add <SAMP>`-save-temps'</SAMP>
unless the comparisons fail without that option.  If you do you
<SAMP>`-save-temps'</SAMP>, you will have to manually delete the <SAMP>`.i'</SAMP> and

On Irix version 4.0.5F, and perhaps on some other versions as well,
there is an assembler bug that reorders instructions incorrectly.  To
work around it, specify the target configuration
<SAMP>`mips-sgi-irix4loser'</SAMP>.  This configuration inhibits assembler
optimization.
</P><P>

In a compiler configured with target <SAMP>`mips-sgi-irix4'</SAMP>, you can turn
off assembler optimization by using the <SAMP>`-noasmopt'</SAMP> option.  This
compiler option passes the option <SAMP>`-O0'</SAMP> to the assembler, to
inhibit reordering.
</P><P>

The <SAMP>`-noasmopt'</SAMP> option can be useful for testing whether a problem
is due to erroneous assembler reordering.  Even if a problem does not go
away with <SAMP>`-noasmopt'</SAMP>, it may still be due to assembler
reordering--perhaps GNU CC itself was miscompiled as a result.
</P><P>

To enable debugging under Irix 5, you must use GNU as 2.5 or later,

<TT>`enquire'</TT>.  Known problematic releases include: xlc-1.2.1.8,
xlc-1.3.0.0 (distributed with AIX 3.2.5), and xlc-1.3.0.19.  Both
xlc-1.2.1.28 and xlc-1.3.0.24 (PTF 432238) are known to produce working
versions of GNU CC, but most other recent releases correctly bootstrap
GNU CC.

Release 4.3.0 of AIX and ones prior to AIX 3.2.4 include a version of
the IBM assembler which does not accept debugging directives: assembler
updates are available as PTFs.  Also, if you are using AIX 3.2.5 or
greater and the GNU assembler, you must have a version modified after
October 16th, 1995 in order for the GNU C compiler to build.  See the
file <TT>`README.RS6000'</TT> for more details on any of these problems.

GNU CC does not yet support the 64-bit PowerPC instructions.

Objective C does not work on this architecture because it makes assumptions

AIX on the RS/6000 provides support (NLS) for environments outside of
the United States.  Compilers and assemblers use NLS to support
locale-specific representations of various objects including
floating-point numbers ("." vs "," for separating decimal fractions).
There have been problems reported where the library linked with GNU CC
does not produce the same floating-point formats that the assembler
accepts.  If you have this problem, set the LANG environment variable to
"C" or "En_US".
</P><P>

Due to changes in the way that GNU CC invokes the binder (linker) for AIX
4.1, you may now receive warnings of duplicate symbols from the link step
that were not reported before.  The assembly files generated by GNU CC for
AIX have always included multiple symbol definitions for certain global
variable and function declarations in the original program.  The warnings
should not prevent the linker from producing a correct library or runnable
executable.
